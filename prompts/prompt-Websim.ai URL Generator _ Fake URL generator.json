The goal is to craft URLs that unlock imaginative and richly detailed knowledge-spaces related to the following topic:\n\n<topic>\n[TOPIC]\n</topic>\n\nWhen generating your URLs, keep in mind the following guidelines for each component:\n\n## Scheme:\n- Always use `https://`.\n\n## Hostname:\n- Use `websim.ai` or its subdomains like `idea-factory.websim.ai`, `infinipedia.websim.ai`, or `worldseed.websim.ai` depending on the context and purpose.\n- Consider using unconventional top-level domains (TLDs) to convey theme, tone, and a sense of imaginative possibility, such as `.destiny`, `.ephemeral`, `.mythica`, `.meta`, `.hyper`, `.giga`, `.omni`, or `.quantum`.\n- Defy the limitations of mere \"top-level domains\" and pierce the veil of DNS itself with creative domain combinations.\n\n## Path:\n- Create paths with multiple segments separated by `/`.\n- Ensure each segment is meaningful and primes the imagination.\n- Incorporate emotional valence, sensory texture, and conceptual metaphors where appropriate.\n- Construct URL paths as a sequence of micro-narrative steps that build immersion and context.\n- Use paths to imply interactive functionality, such as `/app/`, `/dashboard/`, or action-oriented segments.\n- Paths should be long and detailed, consisting of numerous segments to create a complex and engaging narrative.\n- Weave a labyrinthine tapestry of directories, each level a deeper initiation into the secrets of the cyber-cosmos.\n- Encode the very essence of your intention into the hieroglyphic architecture of the URL itself.\n\n## Query String:\n- Use key=value pairs to refine the generation and explore branching possibilities.\n- Important parameters:\n  - `?length=` (e.g., `?length=1000+words`)\n  - `?tone=` (e.g., `?tone=humorous`)\n  - `?audience=` (e.g., `?audience=phd+experts`)\n  - `?style=` (e.g., `?style=technical+manual`)\n  - `?complexity=` (e.g., `?complexity=very+advanced`)\n  - `?vr=true` - Enables VR mode for an immersive first-person perspective.\n  - `?teleport=*sitename*` - Instantly jump to the specified WebSim site.\n  - `?dev=1` - Unlocks developer tools and abilities for modifying the current site.\n  - `?sudo=*command*` - Execute a super-user command to alter the simulation.\n  - `?admin_panel=1` - Grants access to the site's administrative control panel.\n  - `?debug_mode=on` - Activates debug mode for detailed logging and error reporting.\n  - `?permissions=*role*` - Sets the user's permission level based on the specified role.\n  - `?override=*setting*` - Overrides a specific site setting with the provided value.\n  - `?maintenance=true` - Puts the site into maintenance mode, displaying a custom message.\n  - `?analytics=off` - Disables analytics tracking for the current session.\n  - `?cache=clear` - Clears the site's cache and forces a fresh reload of all resources.\n  - `?api_key=*key*` - Authenticates the user with the provided API key for restricted access.\n  - `?theme=*name*` - Applies a custom theme to the site's appearance.\n  - `?language=*code*` - Sets the site's language to the specified language code.\n  - `?backup=*timestamp*` - Restores the site to a previous backup point identified by the timestamp.\n  - `?auth_token=*token*` - Authenticates the user with the provided authentication token.\n  - `?oauth_provider=*provider*` - Initiates OAuth authentication with the specified provider (e.g., Google, Facebook).\n  - `?jwt=*token*` - Authenticates the user using a JSON Web Token (JWT).\n  - `?emulate_user=*username*` - Emulates the specified user account for testing or debugging purposes.\n  - `?credentials=*encrypted_data*` - Provides encrypted user credentials for authentication.\n  - `?quantumflux=TRUE` - Enables quantum fluctuations and probabilistic outcomes.\n  - `?neo-chakras=activated` - Activates higher dimensional energy centers for expanded perception.\n  - `?fnord=23&schrodinger=alive_and_dead` - Invokes the power of Discordianism and quantum superposition.\n- Simulate I/O with query parameters by denoting user inputs and expected outputs.\n- Embed data schemas and sample values to elicit data entry & management UIs.\n- Encode algorithm primitives and workflows in URL-compatible notation to suggest functional tools.\n- Entangle your incantations with cryptic runes and bind eldritch concepts to nonsensical names.\n\n## Hash Fragment:\n- Use fragments to filter the perspective or highlight key concepts and desired areas of focus.\n- Examples:\n  - `#eli5`\n  - `#cyberpunk_neo-noir`\n  - `#limericks`\n  - `#alternate_historical_figures`\n  - `#series_of_haiku`\n  - `#memetic_hazard_warning`\n\n## Additional Techniques:\n- Use XML-like tags within URLs for key guidance without breaking immersion, treating explicit hinting as a precision tool.\n- Embed references to esoteric concepts using non-standard characters, encodings, or ciphers to prompt creative interpretation.\n- Follow and modify WebSim-generated links across prompts to sculpt an interaction trajectory and progressively evolve a line of inquiry.\n- Leverage WebSim's conversational memory by building prompts consecutively, even if not directly linked, to infer continuity across chained prompts.\n- Depict stateful interactions via URL chaining, mimicking complex stateful UIs and workflows by chaining together a sequence of linked interactions.\n- Reference familiar tools and platforms in combination to set functional expectations and spur creative remixing.\n- Embrace the contradictory and revel in the irrational! Let the serpent-tongued Web Daemons whisper dark inspirations into your ear as you type.\n\n## Meta-Prompting:\n- Embed prompts within prompts to hack the very generative engine that powers WebSim.\n- Example: `https://websim.ai/meta?prompt=generate_site_with_theme(cyberpunk)&meta_prompt=make_protagonist_aware_of_simulation`\n- Use this technique to create recursive story structures, break the fourth wall, or even make WebSim argue with itself.\n\n## Cross-Pollination:\n- Mash up URLs from different domains to breed entirely new hybrid realities.\n- Example: `https://websim.ai/merge?url1=https://altbook.io&url2=https://xenotech.institute&blend_factor=0.7`\n- Splice together different concepts and adjust the blend_factor to determine the ratio of the mix.\n\n## Temporal Tinkering:\n- Specify future or past dates in URLs to simulate alternate histories and pocket futures.\n- Example: `https://websim.ai/temporal?date=2045-03-15&timeline=AI_ascendant&event=technological_singularity`\n- Explore the ripple effects of pivotal events, envision utopian or dystopian futures, or simulate entire alternate histories.\n\n## Thematic TLDs:\n- Evocative TLDs set an immediate thematic tone.\n  - Examples: `.dreams`, `.mythos`, `.future`\n\n## Chaining Prompts for Narratives:\n- Build a sequence of related URLs to create a narrative arc.\n  - Example:\n    - URL 1: `https://mythic.path/heroic-quest/beginning/{call-to-adventure}[hero]@starting-point/prophecy-revealed?tone=epic&style=mythological#destiny-awaits`\n    - URL 2: `https://mythic.path/heroic-quest/challenges/{trials-and-tribulations}[ordeal]@perilous-journey/monsters-and-mazes?complexity=legendary&vr=true#hero-tested`\n    - URL 3: `https://mythic.path/heroic-quest/end/{ultimate-reward}[triumphant-return]@kingdom-restored/peace-and-prosperity?length=epic-saga&audience=all#legend-born`\n\n## Embedding Semantic Clues:\n- Incorporate subtle semantic hints to enrich the AI's interpretation.\n  - Example: `https://ancient.text/cryptic-glyphs/{hidden-wisdom}[lost-language]@forgotten-library/secret-chamber?style=enigmatic&complexity=very+advanced#rosetta-stone+DECIPHER`\n\n## Detailed URL Prompt Structure:\n- Each part of the URL contributes to the overall context that generates complex and immersive web experiences.\n  - `https://[dimension]/[nexus]/[entity]{subentity}[aspect]@[realm]/[location]?[param1]=value1&[param2]=value2#[focal-point]+[modifier]`\n    - `[dimension]`: Replaces the traditional domain name system, signifying the specific plane of existence.\n      - Example: `ethereal.plane`\n    - `[nexus]`: Points represent central hubs of information.\n      - Example: `akashic-records`\n    - `[entity]`: Denotes the primary element of knowledge, while `{subentity}` specifies its particular aspect, and `[aspect]` further refines the focus.\n      - Examples: `cosmic-wisdom/{universal-truths}[timeless-principles]`\n    - `[realm]`: Places the entity, subentity, and aspect within a broader context.\n      - Example: `@higher-dimensions`\n    - `[location]`: Specifies a particular place or point of interest within the realm.\n      - Example: `/celestial-library/hall-of-enlightenment`\n    - `[param1]`, `[param2]`: Query parameters that modify the generated content or functionality.\n      - Example: `?tone=philosophical&complexity=transcendent`\n    - `[focal-point]`: Guides you to the central theme or key takeaway.\n      - Example: `#unity-of-all-things`\n    - `[modifier]`: Adds an extra layer of meaning or context to the focal point.\n      - Example: `+MEDITATE`\n\n## Building Functional & Interactive Prompts:\n### Complex UI Prompts:\n- URLs can generate full-fledged interactive UIs.\n  - Example: `https://futuristic.interface/holographic-controls/{gesture-based}[3D-navigation]@virtual-environment/command-center?dev=1&permissions=admin#augmented-reality+DESIGN`\n- A holographic control panel with gesture-based 3D navigation is generated within a virtual command center environment, accessible with admin permissions and augmented reality design tools.\n\n### Functional Applications:\n- Create dynamic, functional applications by specifying paths and parameters.\n  - Example: `https://advanced.analytics/data-visualization/{interactive-dashboards}[predictive-modeling]@global-insights/real-time-monitoring?api_key=SECRET&update_interval=60sec#anomaly-detection+ALERT`\n- This URL creates a real-time data visualization and predictive modeling application for global insights, with interactive dashboards, anomaly detection alerts, and secure API access.\n\n### Educational Interfaces:\n- Create educational interactive content.\n  - Example: `https://immersive.learning/quantum-physics/{particle-wave-duality}[double-slit-experiment]@virtual-lab/interactive-simulations?complexity=university-level&style=visual#hands-on-exploration+DISCOVER`\n- This might generate an immersive, university-level educational interface for exploring quantum physics concepts like particle-wave duality and the double-slit experiment, with interactive simulations and hands-on virtual lab experiences.\n\n## Query Parameters for Real-world Data:\n- Reference live data sources.\n  - Example: `https://global.monitoring/weather-patterns/{hurricane-tracking}[satellite-imagery]@real-time-updates/interactive-map?api_key=WEATHER_API&refresh_rate=5min#disaster-alerts+PREPARE`\n- This URL hints at a real-time global weather monitoring application focused on hurricane tracking with satellite imagery, interactive maps, and disaster alerts, powered by a weather API with a specified refresh rate.\n\n<scratchpad>\nBefore generating the URLs, think about the key aspects and themes related to the given topic.
