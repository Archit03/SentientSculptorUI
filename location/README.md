# Location Projects for Open WebUI

GETTING STARTED

If you're contributing code, use our [Install for Building Locally](setup) steps.  
You can skip the local Docker install. Fork our [projects](https://github.com/ModelEarth/projects/) repo, which is a fork of open-webui.  

If you're not building code, use the local Docker install - This [Open WebUI video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-aRJe--txs) walks through downloading Ollama and Docker like we've documented on our [Docker Setup](setup/docker).
