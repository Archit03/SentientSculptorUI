The end of this\\ndocument contains more resources for improving your writing.\\n\\n\\nSome people believe that writing papers, giving\\ntalks, and similar “marketing” activities are not part of\\nresearch, but an adjunct to it or even an undesirable distraction.  This\\nview is inaccurate.  The purpose of research is to increase the store of\\nhuman knowledge, and so even the very best work is useless if you cannot\\neffectively communicate it to the rest of the world.  If a paper is poorly\\nwritten, then readers might conclude you spent as little effort on the\\nresearch that it describes.\\n\\n\\nEqually importantly, writing papers and giving\\ntalks will clarify your thinking and thereby improve your research.\\nYou may be surprised how difficult it is to clearly communicate your ideas\\nand contributions; doing so will force you to understand them more deeply\\nand enable you to improve them.\\n\\nKnow your message, and stay on message\\n\\nThe goal of writing a paper is to change people\\'s behavior:  for instance,\\nto change the way they think about a research problem or to convince them\\nto use a new approach.  Determine your goal (also known as your thesis),\\nand focus the paper around that goal.\\n\\n\\nAs a general rule, your paper needs to convince the audience of three key\\npoints.  If any of these is missing or unclear, the\\npaper will not be compelling.\\n\\n\\n\\n    The problem is important.\\n    The problem has a significant impact and consequences.\\n    You can buttress your argument by showing that others consider the\\n    problem important.\\n  \\n\\n    The problem is hard.\\n    Explain that obvious techniques and existing approaches do not suffice.\\n    Showing what others have tried can be effective here.\\n  \\n\\n    You have solved the problem.  This is often demonstrated via\\n    experiments.  Keep in mind how you expect the\\n    behavior of readers to change once they appreciate your contributions.\\n    \\n    You\\'ll also need to convince readers that your contributions are novel.\\n    When expressing this, it is helpful to explain why no one else thought\\n    of your approach before (or why, if they thought of it, they would have\\n    rejected the approach) , and whether similar insights apply to other problems.\\n  \\n\\n\\nBefore you write your paper, you need to understand your audience.\\nWho will read your paper?  What are their backgrounds, motivations,\\ninterests, and beliefs?  What are the key points you want a reader person\\nto take away from your paper?\\nOnce you know the thesis and audience, you can determine what points your\\ndocument should make to achieve its purpose.\\n\\n\\nFor each point in your paper, you need to explain both what and\\nwhy.  Start with what, but don\\'t omit why.\\nFor example, it is not enough to state how an algorithm works; you should explain\\nwhy it works in that way, or why another way of solving the problem would\\nbe different.  Similarly, it is not sufficient to present a figure or\\nfacts.  You must also ensure that reader understands\\nthe significance or implications of the figure and what parts of it are\\nmost important.\\n\\nWhich details to include\\n\\nYour purpose is to communicate specific ideas, and everything about your\\npaper should contribute to this goal.  If any part of the paper does not\\nsupport your main point, then delete or change that part.  You must be\\nruthless in cutting every irrelevant detail, however true it may be.\\nEverything in your paper that does not support your main point distracts\\nfrom it.\\n\\n\\nWrite for the readers, rather than writing for yourself.  In particular,\\nthink about what matters to the intended audience, and focus on that.  \\nIt is not necessarily what you personally find most intriguing.\\n\\n\\nA common mistake is to focus on what you spent the most time on.  Do not\\nwrite your paper as a chronological narrative of all the things that you\\ntried, and do not devote space in the paper proportionately to the amount\\nof time you spent on each task.  Most work that you do will never show up\\nin any paper; the purpose of infrastructure-building and exploration of\\nblind alleys is to enable you to do the small amount of work that is worth\\nwriting about.  Another way of stating this is that the purpose of the\\npaper is not to describe what you have done, but to inform readers of the\\nsuccessful outcome or significant results, and to convince readers of the\\nvalidity of those conclusions.\\n\\n\\nLikewise, do not dwell on details of the implementation or the\\nexperiments except insofar as they contribute to your main point.\\nThis is a particularly important piece of advice for software\\ndocumentation, where you need to focus on the software\\'s benefits to the\\nuser, and how to use it, rather than how you implemented it.  However, it\\nholds for technical papers as well — and remember that readers expect\\ndifferent things from the two types of writing!\\n\\n\\nThe audience is interested in what worked, and why, so start with that.  If\\nyou discuss approaches that were not successful, do so briefly, and\\ntypically only after you have discussed the successful approach.\\nFurthermore, the discussion should focus on differences from the successful\\ntechnique, and if at all possible should provide general rules or lessons\\nlearned that will yield insight and help others to avoid such blind alleys\\nin the future.\\n\\n\\nWhenever you introduce a strawman or an inferior approach, say so upfront.\\nA reader will (and should) assume that whatever you write in a paper is\\nsomething you believe or advocate, unless very clearly marked otherwise.  A\\npaper should never first detail a technique, then (without forewarning)\\nindicate that the technique is flawed and proceed to discuss another\\ntechnique.  Such surprises confuse and irritate readers.  This mistake is\\noften called “leading the reader down the garden path”.\\n\\n\\nWhen there are multiple possible approaches to a problem, it is preferable\\nto give the best or successful one first.  Oftentimes it is not even necessary\\nto discuss the alternatives.  If you do, they should generally come after,\\nnot before, the successful one.  Your paper should give the most important\\ndetails first, and the less important ones afterward.  Its main line of\\nargument should flow coherently rather than being interrupted.  It can be\\nacceptable to state an imperfect solution first (with a clear indication\\nthat it is imperfect) if it is a simpler version of the full solution, and\\nthe full solution is a direct modification of the simpler one.  Less\\ncommonly, it can be acceptable to state an imperfect solution first if it\\nis an obvious solution that every reader will assume is adequate; but use\\ncare with this rationalization, since you are usually wrong that every\\nreader will jump to the given conclusion.\\n\\nMake the organization and results clear\\n\\nA paper should communicate the main ideas of your research (such as the\\ntechniques and results) early and clearly.  Then, the body of the paper can\\nexpand on these points; a reader who understands the structure and big\\nideas can better appreciate the details.  Another way of saying this is\\nthat you should give away the punchline.  A technical paper is not a joke\\nor a mystery novel.  The reader should not encounter any surprises, only\\ndeeper explanations of ideas that have already been introduced.  It\\'s\\nparticularly irritating when an abstract or introduction states, “We\\nevaluated the relationship between baldness and beekeeping”, with the key\\nresults buried pages later.  A better abstract would say, “Male beekeepers\\nare 25% more likely to be bald (p=.04), but there is no statistically\\nsignificant correlation for female beekeepers.”\\n\\n\\nThe same advice applies at the level of sections and paragraphs.  It is a\\nbad approach to start with a mass of details and only at the end tell the\\nreader what the main point was or how the details related to one another.\\nInstead, state the point first and then support it.  The reader is  more\\nlikely to appreciate which evidence is important and why, and is less\\nlikely to become confused or frustrated.\\n\\n\\nFor each section of the paper, consider writing a mini-introduction that\\nsays what its organization is, what is in each subpart, and how the parts\\nrelate to one another.  For the whole paper, this is probably a paragraph.\\nFor a section or sub-section, it can be as short as a sentence.  This may\\nfeel redundant to you (the author), but readers haven\\'t spent as much time\\nwith the paper\\'s structure as you have, so they will truly appreciate these\\nsignposts that orient them within your text.\\n\\n\\nSome people like to write the abstract, and often also the introduction,\\nlast.  Doing so makes them easier to write, because the rest of the paper\\nis already complete and can just be described.  However, I prefer to write\\nthese sections early in the process (and then revise them as needed), because\\nthey frame the paper.  If you know the paper\\'s organization and outlook,\\nthen writing the front matter will take little effort.  If you don\\'t, then\\nit is an excellent use of your time to determine that information by\\nwriting the front matter.  To write the body of the paper\\nwithout knowing its broad outlines will take more time in the long run.\\nAnother way of putting this is that \\nwriting the paper first will make writing the abstract faster, and writing\\nthe abstract first will make writing the paper faster.  There is a lot more\\npaper than abstract, so it makes sense to start with that and to clarify\\nthe point of the paper early on.\\n\\n\\nIt is a very common error to dive into the technical approach or the\\nimplementation details without first appropriately framing the problem and\\nproviding motivation and background.  Readers need to understand what the\\ntask is before they are convinced that they should pay attention to what\\nyou are saying about it.  You should first say what the problem or goal is,\\nand — even when presenting an algorithm — first state what the\\noutput is and probably the key idea, before discussing steps.  Avoid\\nproviding information that isn\\'t useful to readers/users.  It just\\ndistracts from the important content.\\n\\nGetting started: overcoming writer\\'s block and procrastination\\n\\nSome writers are overwhelmed by the emptiness of a blank page or editor\\nbuffer, and they have trouble getting started with their writing.  Don\\'t\\nworry!  Here are some tricks to help you get started.  Once you have begun,\\nyou will find it relatively easier to revise your notes or first draft.\\nThe key idea is to write something, and you can improve it later.\\n\\n\\nStart verbally.  Explain what the paper needs to say to another\\nperson.  After the conversation is over, write down what you just said,\\nfocusing on the main points rather than every word you spoke.  Many people\\nfind it easier to speak than to write.  Furthermore, getting feedback and\\ngiving clarifications will help you discover problems with your argument,\\nexplanation, or word choice.\\n\\n\\nOutline.  You may not be ready to write full English paragraphs, but\\nyou can decide which sections your paper will have and give them\\ndescriptive titles.  Once you have decided on the section structure, you\\ncan write a little outline of each section, which indicates the subsection\\ntitles.  Now, expand that into a topic sentence for each paragraph.  At\\nthis point, since you know the exact topic of each paragraph, you will find\\nthe paragraph easy to write.\\n\\n\\nStream-of-consciousness notes.  Write down everything that you know,\\nin no particular order and with no particular formatting.  Afterward,\\norganize what you wrote thematically, bringing related points together.\\nEventually, convert it into an outline and proceed as above.  While writing\\nnotes, use phrases/keywords, not complete sentences.  The phrases\\nare quicker to write and less likely to derail your brainstorming; they are\\neasier to organize; and you will feel less attached to them and more\\nwilling to delete them.\\n\\n\\nDivide and conquer.  Rather than trying to write your entire\\ndocument, choose some specific part, and write just that part.  Then, move\\non to another part.\\n\\n\\nRe-use.  Find other text that you have written on the topic and start\\nfrom that.  An excellent source is your\\nprogress reports — you are writing\\nthem, aren\\'t you?  This can remind you what was hard or interesting, or of\\npoints that you might otherwise forget to make.  You will rarely want to\\nre-use text verbatim, both because you can probably convey the point better\\nnow, and also because writing for different audiences or in different\\ncontexts requires a different argument or phrasing.  For example, a\\ntechnical paper and a technical talk have\\nsimilar aims but rather different forms.\\n\\n\\nYou must be willing to delete and/or rewrite your notes and\\nearly drafts.  If you wrote something once, you can write it again\\n(probably better!).  Early on, the point is to organize your ideas, not to\\ncreate finished sentences.\\n\\nBrevity\\n\\nBe brief.  Make every word count.  If a word does not support your point,\\ncut it out, because excess verbiage and fluff only make it harder for the\\nreader to appreciate your message.  Use shorter and more direct phrases\\nwherever possible.\\n\\n\\nMake your writing crisp and to the point.  Eliminate any text that does not\\nsupport your point.  Here is one way you might go about this; it is\\ntime-consuming but extremely effective.  First, examine each section of the\\npaper in turn and ask what role it serves and whether it contributes to the\\npaper\\'s main point.  If not, delete it.  Next, within each section, examine\\neach paragraph.  Ask whether that paragraph has a single point.  If not,\\nrewrite the paragraph.  Also ask whether that point contributes to the\\ngoals of the section.  If not, then delete the paragraph.  Next, within\\neach paragraph, examine each sentence.  If it does not make a single, clear\\npoint that strengthens the paragraph, delete or rewrite it.  Finally,\\nwithin each sentence, examine each word, and delete or replace those that\\ndo not strengthen their point.  You will need to repeat this entire process\\nmultiple times, keeping a fresh perspective on the paper.\\n\\n\\nSome people find it easier to follow this approach bottom-up, first\\ncutting/rewriting words, then sentences, etc.\\n\\nWriting style\\n\\nPassive voice has no place in technical writing.  It obscures who the\\nactor was, what caused it, and when it happened.  Use active voice and\\nsimple, clear, direct phrasing.\\n\\n\\n\\n  First person is rarely appropriate in technical writing.\\n\\n\\n\\n    First person is appropriate when describing something that the author of the\\n    paper did manually.  Recall that your paper should not be couched as a\\n    narrative.\\n  \\n\\n    Do not use “we” to mean “the author and the\\n    reader” or “the paper”.  For example, do not write\\n    “In this section, we ...”.\\n  \\n\\n    Do not use “we” to describe the operation of a program or system.\\n    “We compute a graph” makes it sound like the authors did it by\\n    hand.  As a related point, do not anthropomorphize computers:  they\\n    hate it.  Anthropomorphism, such as “the program thinks that\\n    ...”, is unclear and vague.\\n  \\n\\n\\nAvoid puffery, self-congratulation, superlatives, and subjective or value\\njudgments:  give the objective facts and let the reader judge.  Avoid vague\\nterms like “sizable” and “significant” (which are\\nalso subjective).  Don\\'t overuse the word “novel”.\\n\\n\\nDo not use words like “clearly”, “easily”,\\n“obviously”, and “trivially”, as\\nin “Obviously, this Taylor series sums to π.” If the point is\\nreally obvious, then you are just wasting words by pointing it out.  And if\\nthe point is not obvious to readers who are not intimately familiar with the\\nsubject matter the way you are, then you are offending readers by\\ninsulting their intelligence, and you are demonstrating your own inability to\\ncommunicate the intuition.\\n\\n\\nPrefer singular to plural number.  In “sequences induce\\ngraphs”, it is not clear whether the two collections are in\\none-to-one correspondence, or the set of sequences collectively induces a\\nset of graphs; “each sequence induces a graph” avoids this\\nconfusion.  Likewise, in “graphs might contain paths”, it is\\nunclear whether a given graph might contain multiple paths, or might\\ncontain at most one path.\\n\\n\\nWhen describing an experiment or some other event or action that occurred in the\\npast, use past tense.  For example, the methodology section might\\nsay “We ran the program”.  It would be ungrammatical and\\nconfusing to use present tense, as in “We run the program”.\\nPresent tense is for ongoing events (“I write this letter to inform\\nyou...”) or regular events (“I brush my teeth each day”),\\nbut not past events (“Yesterday, I eat dinner with my family”).\\nIt is also correct to say “Our methodology was to run the\\nprogram”, where you use past tense “was” and\\nthe infinitive “to run”.\\n\\n\\nWhen describing the paper itself, use present tense.  “This paper\\nshows that ...”.  The reason for this is that the reader is experiencing\\nthe paper in real time.\\n\\n\\nAvoid gratuitous use of the future tense “will ...”, as in, “switching the\\nred and green wires will cause the bomb to explode”.  It is unclear\\nwhen the action will occur.\\nIf it is an immediate effect, use the\\nshorter and more direct “switching the red and green wires causes the\\nbomb to explode”.\\n\\n\\nUse “previous work” instead of “existing work”.\\nYour work exists, so “existing work” would refer to it as well.\\n\\n\\nIn a list with 3 or more elements list, put a serial comma between each\\nof the items (including the last two).  As a simple example of\\nwhy, consider this 3-element grocery list written without the clarifying\\nlast comma: “milk, macaroni and cheese and crackers”.  It\\'s not\\nclear whether that means { milk, macaroni and cheese, crackers } or { milk,\\nmacaroni, cheese and crackers }.  As another example, “I would like\\nto thank my parents, Rene Descartes and Ayn Rand,” suggests rather\\nunusual parentage, whereas “I would like to thank my parents, Rene\\nDescartes, and Ayn Rand,” shows a debt to four people.  I\\'ve seen\\nreal examples that were even more confusing than these.\\n\\n\\nIn English, compound adjectives are hyphenated but compound nouns are not.\\nConsider “the semantics provide name protection” versus\\n“the name-protection semantics”.\\n\\n\\nPrefer unambiguous words to ambiguous ones.  Do not use “as” or\\n“since” to mean “because”.  Do not use\\n“if” to mean “whether”.\\n\\n\\nUse quotations sparingly.  A clear paraphrase of the points that are\\nrelevant to your own work (along with a proper citation) is usually better\\nthan a long quotation from a previous publication.\\n\\n\\nAvoid third-person pronouns when you can.  The old standard was\\n“he”, which is masculine chauvinist.  The new standard is\\n“he or she”, which can be viewed as heteronormative and which\\nsome people find clumsy.  An emerging standard is “they” as a\\nfirst-person singular pronoun, which is inclusive but\\ngrammatically incorrect\\nand confusing\\n(see comments above about singular vs. plural number).\\n\\n\\nSome of the suggestions in this document are about good writing, and that\\nmight seem secondary to the research.  But writing more clearly will help\\nyou think more clearly and often reveals flaws (or ideas!) that had\\npreviously been invisible even to you.  Furthermore, if your writing is not\\ngood, then either readers will not be able to comprehend your good ideas,\\nor readers will be (rightly) suspicious of your technical work.  If you do\\nnot (or cannot) write well, why should readers believe you were any more\\ncareful in the research itself?  The writing reflects on you, so make it\\nreflect well.\\n\\nFigures\\n\\nUse figures!  Different people learn in different ways, so you should\\ncomplement a textual or mathematical presentation with a graphical one.\\nEven for people whose primary learning modality is textual, another\\npresentation of the ideas can clarify, fill gaps, or enable the reader to\\nverify his or her understanding.  Figures can also help to illustrate\\nconcepts, draw a skimming reader into the text (or at least communicate a\\nkey idea to that reader).  Figures make the paper more visually appealing.\\n\\n\\nIt is extremely helpful to give an example to clarify your ideas:  this can\\nmake concrete in the reader\\'s mind what your technique does (and why it is\\nhard or interesting).  A running example used throughout the paper is also helpful in\\nillustrating how your algorithm works, and a single example permits you to\\namortize the time and space spent explaining the example (and the reader\\'s time in\\nappreciating it).\\nIt\\'s harder to find or create a single example that you re-use throughout\\nthe paper, but it is worth it.\\n\\n\\nA figure should stand on its own, containing all the information that is\\nnecessary to understand it.\\nGood captions contain multiple sentences; the caption provides context and\\nexplanation.  For examples of good, informative captions, see the print\\neditions of magazines such\\nas Scientific\\nAmerican\\nand American\\nScientist.\\nThe caption should state what the figure illustrates or what conclusion a\\nreader should draw from it.  Don\\'t write an obvious description of what the\\nfigure is, such as \"Code example\". Never write a caption like “The\\nFoobar technique”; the caption should also say what the Foobar\\ntechnique is, what it is good for, or how it works.\\nThe caption may also need to explain the meaning of columns in a table or\\nof symbols in a figure.  However, it\\'s even better to put that information\\nin the figure proper; for example, use labels or a legend.  When the body\\nof your paper contains information that belongs in a caption, there are\\nseveral negative effects.  The reader is forced to hunt all over the paper\\nin order to understand the figure.  The flow of the writing is interrupted\\nwith details that are relevant only when one is looking at the figure.  The\\nfigures become ineffective at drawing in a reader who is scanning the paper\\n— an important constituency that you should cater to!\\n\\n\\nAs with naming, use pictorial elements consistently.\\nOnly use two different types of arrows (or boxes, shading, etc.) when they\\ndenote distinct concepts; do not introduce inconsistency just because\\nit pleases your personal aesthetic sense.  Almost any diagram with multiple\\ntypes of elements requires a legend (either explicitly in the diagram, or\\nin the caption) to explain what each one means; and so do many diagrams\\nwith just one type of element, to explain what it means.\\n\\n\\nSome writers label all the types of figures differently — some as\\n“figure”, others as “table” or\\n“graph” or “picture”.  This differentiation has no\\nbenefits, but it does have a drawback:  it is very hard for a reader to\\nfind “table 3”, which might appear after “figure 7”\\nbut before “freehand drawing 1”.  You should simply call them\\nall figures and number them sequentially.  The body of each figure might be\\na table, a graph, a diagram, a screenshot, or any other content.\\n\\n\\nPut figures at the top of the page, not in the middle or bottom.\\nIf a numbered, captioned\\nfigure appears in the middle or at the bottom of a page, it is harder for\\nreaders to find the next paragraph of text while reading, and harder to\\nfind the figure from a reference to it.\\n\\n\\nAvoid bitmaps, which are hard to read.  Export figures from your drawing\\nprogram in a vector graphics format.  If you must use a bitmap (which is\\nonly appropriate for screenshots of a tool), then produce them at very high\\nresolution.  Use the biggest-resolution screen you can, and magnify the\\nportion you will capture.\\n\\n\\nDon\\'t waste text in the paper (and tax the reader\\'s patience) regurgitating\\ninformation that is expressed more precisely and concisely in a figure.\\nFor example, the text should not repeat the numbers from a table or graph.\\nText in the paper should add insight or explanations, or summarize the\\nconclusions to be drawn from the data in the figure.\\n\\nComputer program source code\\n\\nYour code examples should either be real code, or should be close to real\\ncode.  Never use synthetic examples such as procedures or variables named\\nfoo or bar.  Made-up examples are much harder for readers\\nto understand and to build intuition regarding.  Furthermore, they give the\\nreader the impression that your technique is not applicable in practice\\n— you couldn\\'t find any real examples to illustrate it, so you had to\\nmake something up.\\n\\n\\nAny boldface or other highlighting should be used to indicate the most\\nimportant parts of a text.  In code snippets, it should never be used to\\nhighlight syntactic elements such as “public” or\\n“int”, because that is not the part to which you want to draw\\nthe reader\\'s eye.  (Even if your IDE happens to do that, it isn\\'t\\nappropriate for a paper.)  For example, it would be acceptable to use\\nboldface to indicate the names of procedures (helping the reader find them),\\nbut not their return types.\\n\\nNaming\\n\\nGive each concept in your paper a descriptive name to make it more\\nmemorable to readers.  Never use terms like\\n“approach 1”, “approach 2”, or “our\\napproach”, and avoid acronyms when possible.  If you can\\'t think of a\\ngood name, then quite likely you don\\'t really understand the concept.\\nThink harder about it to determine its most important or salient features.\\n\\n\\nIt is better to name a technique (or a paper section, etc.) based on\\nwhat it does rather than how it does it.\\n\\n\\nUse terms consistently and precisely.  Avoid “elegant\\nvariation”, which uses different terms for the same concept to avoid\\nboredom on the part of the reader or to emphasize different aspects of the\\nconcept.  While elegant variation may be appropriate in poems, novels, and\\nsome essays, it is not acceptable in technical writing, where you should\\nclearly define terms when they are first introduced, then use them\\nconsistently.  If you switch wording gratuitously, you will confuse the\\nreader and muddle your point.  A reader of a technical paper expects that\\nuse of a different term flags a different meaning, and will wonder what\\nsubtle difference you are trying to highlight.  Thus, don\\'t confuse the\\nreader by substituting “program”, “library”,\\n“component”, “system”, and “artifact”,\\nnor by conflating “technique”, “idea”,\\n“method” and “approach”, nor by switching among\\n“program”, “code”, and “source”.\\nChoose the best word for the concept, and stick with it.\\n\\n\\nDo not use a single term to refer to multiple concepts.  If you use the\\nterm “technique” for every last idea that you introduce in your\\npaper, then readers will become confused.  This is a place that use of\\nsynonyms to distinguish concepts that are unrelated (from the point of view\\nof your paper) is acceptable.  For instance, you might always use\\n“phase” when describing an algorithm but “step”\\nwhen describing how a user uses a tool.\\n\\n\\nWhen you present a list, be consistent in how you introduce each element,\\nand either use special formatting to make them stand out or else state the\\nsize of the list.  Don\\'t use, “There are several reasons I am smart.\\nI am intelligent.  Second, I am bright.  Also, I am clever.  Finally, I am\\nbrilliant.” Instead, use “There are four reasons I am smart.\\nFirst, I am intelligent.  Second, I am bright.  Third, I am clever.\\nFourth, I am brilliant.” Especially when the points are longer, this\\nmakes the argument much easier to follow.  Some people worry that such\\nconsistency and repetition is pedantic or stilted, or it makes the writing\\nhard to follow.  There is no need for such concerns:  none of these is the\\ncase.  It\\'s more important to make your argument clear than to achieve\\n“elegant variation” at the expense of clarity.\\n\\n\\nChoose good names not only for the concepts that you present in your paper,\\nbut for the document source file.  Don\\'t name the file after the conference\\nto which you are submitting (the paper might be rejected) or the year.\\nEven if the paper is accepted, such a name won\\'t tell you what the paper is\\nabout when you look over your files in later years.  Instead,\\ngive the paper or its folder/directory a name that reflects its content.\\nAnother benefit is that this will also lead you to think about the paper in\\nterms of its content and contributions.\\n\\n\\nHere is a piece of advice that is specific to computing:  do not use the\\nvague, nontechnical term “bug”.  Instead, use one of the\\nstandard terms\\nfault, error, or failure.  A fault is an underlying defect in a system,\\nintroduced by a human.  A failure is a user-visible manifestation of the\\nfault or defect.  In other circumstances, “bug report” may be more\\nappropriate than “bug”.\\n\\nNumbers and measurements\\n\\n  Digits of precision:\\n\\n\\n\\n    Don\\'t report more digits of precision than the measurement process reliably\\n    and reproducibly produces.\\n    The 3rd or 4th digit of precision is rarely accurate and\\n    generalizable; if you don\\'t have confidence that it is both repeatable\\n    and generalizable to new experiments, omit it.\\n    Another way to say this is that if you are not confident that a\\n    different set of experiments would produce all the same digits, then\\n    don\\'t report so much precision.\\n  \\n\\n    Don\\'t report more digits of precision than needed to convey your message.\\n    If the difference between 4.13 and 4 will not make a difference in\\n    convincing readers, then don\\'t report the extra digits.  Reporting extra\\n    digits can distract readers from the larger trends and the big picture.\\n    Including an inappropriate number of digits of precision can cast suspicion\\n    on all of your results, by giving readers the impression that you are\\n    statistically naive.\\n  \\n\\n    Use a consistent number of digits of precision.  If the measured data are\\n    1.23, 45.67, and 891.23, for example, you might report them as 1.23, 45.7,\\n    and 891, or as 1.2, 46, and 890, or as 1, 50, and 900.  (An exception is\\n    when data are known to sum to a particular value; I would report 93% and\\n    7% rather than either 93% and 7.4% or 90% and 7%.  Often it\\'s\\n    appropriate to report percentages as whole numbers rather than using\\n    the same precision.)\\n  \\n\\n    If you do any computations such as ratios, your computations should\\n    internally use the full precision of your actual measurements, even\\n    though your paper reports only a limited number of digits of precision.\\n  \\n\\n    If a measurement is exact, such as a count of items, then it can be\\n    acceptable to give the entire number even if it has many digits; by\\n    contrast, timings and other inexact measurements should always be reported\\n    with a limited number of digits of precision.\\n  \\n\\n\\nDo not confuse relative and absolute measurements.  For instance, suppose\\nyour medicine cures 30% of patients, and the placebo cures 25% of patients.\\nYou could report that your medicine\\'s cure rate is .3, the placebo\\'s cure\\nrate is .25, and your medicine\\'s cure rate is either .05 greater or 20%\\ngreater.  (Other correct, but less good, ways to say the same thing are\\nthat it cures 20% more, 120% as many, or 1.2 times as many patients.)\\n\\nIt would be inaccurate to state that your medicine cures 5% more patients\\nor your medicine cures 120% more patients.  Just as you need to correctly\\nuse “120% more” versus “120% as many”, you need to\\ncorrectly use “3 times faster than” versus “3 times as\\nfast as”.  A related, also common, confusion is between “3\\ntimes faster than and 3 times as fast as”.  And, “2 times\\nfewer” makes absolutely no sense.  I would avoid these terms\\nentirely.  “Half as many” is a much better substitute for\\n“2 times fewer”.\\n\\n\\nGiven the great ease of misunderstanding what a percentage means or what\\nits denominator is, I try to avoid percentages and focus on fractions\\nwhenever possible, especially for base measurements.  For comparisons\\nbetween techniques, percentages can be acceptable.  Avoid presenting two\\ndifferent measurements that are both percentages but have\\ndifferent denominators.\\n\\nProcessing data\\n\\nYour paper probably includes tables, bibliographies, or other content that\\nis generated from external data.  Your paper may also be written in a text\\nformatting language such as LaTeX.  In each of these cases, it is necessary\\nto run some external command to create some of the content or to create the\\nfinal PDF.\\n\\n\\nAll of the steps to create your final paper should be clearly documented\\n— say, in comments or in a notes file that you maintain with the\\npaper.  Preferably, they should be automated so that you only have to\\nrun one command that collects all the data, creates the tables, and\\ngenerates the final PDF.\\n\\n\\nIf you document and automate these steps, then you can easily regenerate\\nthe paper when needed.  This is useful if you re-run experiments or\\nanalysis, or if you need to defend your results against a criticism by\\nother researchers.  If you leave some steps manual, then you or your\\ncolleagues are highly likely to make a mistake (leading to a scientific\\nerror) or to be unable to reproduce your results later.\\n\\n\\nOne good way to automate these tasks is by writing a program or creating a\\nscript for a build system such as Ant, Gradle, Make, Maven, etc.\\n\\nRelated work\\n\\nA related work section should not only explain what research others have\\ndone, but in each case should compare and contrast that to your work and\\nalso to other related work.  After reading your related work section, a\\nreader should understand the key idea and contribution of each significant\\npiece of related work, how they fit together (what are the common themes or\\napproaches in the research community?), and how your work differs.  Don\\'t\\nwrite a related work section that is just a list of other papers, with a\\nsentence about each one that was lifted from its abstract, and without any\\ncritical analysis nor deep comparison to other work.\\n\\n\\nUnless your approach is a small variation on another technique, it is\\nusually best to defer the related work to the end of the paper.  When it\\ncomes first, it gives readers the impression that your work is rather\\nderivative.  (If this is true, it is your responsibility to convey that\\nclearly; if it is not true, then it\\'s misleading to intimate it.)\\nYou need to ensure that readers understand your technique in its entirety,\\nand also understand its relationship to other work; different orders can\\nwork in different circumstances.\\n\\n\\n\\nJust as you should generally explain your technique first, and later show\\nrelationships with other work, it is also usually more effective to defer a\\ndetailed discussion of limitations to a later section rather than the main\\ndescription of your technique.  You should be straightforward and honest\\nabout the limitations, of course (do mention them early on, even if you\\ndon\\'t detail them then), but don\\'t destroy the coherence of your narrative\\nor sour the reader on your technique.\\n\\nFeedback\\n\\nGet feedback!  Finish your paper well in advance, so that you can\\nimprove the writing.  Even re-reading your own text after being away from\\nit can show you things that you didn\\'t notice.  An outside reader can tell\\nyou even more.\\n\\n\\nWhen readers misunderstand the paper, that is always\\nat least partly the author\\'s fault!  Even if you think the readers have\\nmissed the point, you will learn how your work can be misinterpreted, and\\neliminating those ambiguities will improve the paper.\\n\\n\\nBe considerate to your reviewers, who are spending their time to help you.\\nHere are several ways to do that.\\n\\n\\nAs with submission to conferences, don\\'t waste anyone\\'s time if there are\\nmajor flaws.  Only ask someone to read (a part of) your paper when you\\nthink you will learn something new, because you are not aware of serious\\nproblems.  If only parts are ready, it is best to indicate this in the\\npaper itself (e.g., a TODO comment that the reader will see or a\\nhand-written annotation on a hardcopy) rather than verbally or in email\\nthat can get forgotten or separated from the paper.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is most effective to get feedback sequentially rather than in parallel.\\nRather than asking 3 people to read the same version of your paper, ask one\\nperson to read the paper, then make corrections before asking the next\\nperson to read it, and so on.  This prevents you from getting the same\\ncomments repeatedly — subsequent readers can give you new feedback\\nrather than repeating what you already knew, and you\\'ll get feedback on\\nsomething that is closer to the final version.  If you ask multiple reviewers\\nat once, you are de-valuing their time — you are indicating that you\\ndon\\'t mind if they waste their time saying something you already know.  You\\nmight ask multiple reviewers if you are not confident of their judgment or\\nif you are very confident the paper already is in good shape, in which\\ncase there are unlikely to be major issues that every reviewer stumbles\\nover.\\n\\n\\nIt usually best not to email the document, but to provide a location from which\\nreviewers can obtain the latest version of the paper, such as a version\\ncontrol repository or a URL you will update.  That way, you won\\'t clutter\\ninboxes with many revisions, and readers can always get the most recent copy.\\n\\n\\nBe generous with your time when colleagues need comments on their papers:\\nyou will help them, you will learn what to emulate or avoid, and they will\\nbe more willing to review your writing.\\n\\n\\nSome of your best feedback will be from yourself, especially as you get\\nmore thoughtful and introspective about your writing.  To take advantage of\\nthis, start writing early.  One good way to do this is to write a periodic\\nprogress report that describes your\\nsuccesses and failures.  The progress report will give you practice\\nwriting about your work, oftentimes trying out new explanations.\\n\\n\\nWhereas you should start writing as early as possible, you don\\'t need to\\nput that writing in the form of a technical paper right away.  In fact,\\nit\\'s usually best to outline the technical paper, and get feedback on that,\\nbefore you start to fill in the sections with text.  (You might think that\\nyou can copy existing text into the paper, but it usually works out better\\nto write the information anew.  With your knowledge of the overall\\nstructure, goals, and audience, you will be able to do a much better job\\nthat fits with the paper\\'s narrative.)\\nWhen outlining, I like to start with one sentence about the paper; then\\nwrite one sentence for each section of the paper; then write one sentence\\nfor each subsection; then write one sentence for each paragraph (think of\\nthis as the topic sentence); and at that point, it\\'s remarkably easy just\\nto flesh out the paragraphs.\\n\\nWhen to submit your paper for publication\\n\\nYou should not submit your paper too early, when it does not reflect well\\non you and a submission would waste the community\\'s reviewing resources.\\nYou should not submit your paper too late, because then the community is\\ndeprived of your scientific insights.  In general, you should err on the\\nside of submitting too late rather than too early.\\n\\n\\nA rule of thumb is to submit only if you are proud for the world to\\nassociate your name with the work, in its current form.  If you\\nknow of significant criticisms that reviewers might raise, then don\\'t\\nsubmit the paper.\\n\\n\\nSubmitting your paper prematurely has many negative consequences.\\n\\n\\n\\n    You will waste the time of hard-working reviewers, who will give you\\n    feedback that you could have obtained in other ways.\\n  \\n\\n    You will get a reputation for shoddy work.\\n  \\n\\n    You will make the paper less likely to be accepted in the future.\\n    Oftentimes the same reviewers may serve two different venues.\\n    Reviewing a paper again puts a reviewer in a negative state of mind.  I\\n    have frequently heard reviewers say, “I read an earlier version of this\\n    paper, it was a bad paper, and this version is similar.”  (This is\\n    unethical because reviewers are not supposed to talk about papers they\\n    have reviewed, but nonetheless it is very common.)  Now the paper will\\n    likely be rejected again, and the whole committee gets a bad impression\\n    of you.  A reviewer who has read a previous version of the paper may\\n    read the resubmission less carefully or make assumptions based on a\\n    previous version.  To sum up:  it\\'s harder to get a given paper\\n    accepted on its second submission, than it would have been to get the\\n    identical paper accepted on its first submission.\\n  \\n\\n\\nHere are some bad reasons to submit a paper.\\n\\n\\n\\n    You need feedback on the paper.\\n\\n    \\n    It\\'s true that the feedback from reviewers is extraordinarily valuable\\n    to you and will help you improve the paper.  However, you should get\\n    feedback from other scientists (your friends and colleagues) before\\n    submitting for publication.\\n    \\n\\n\\n    Submitting the paper in its current form means more papers on your\\n    c.v. and more opportunities for others to learn about your work.\\n\\n    \\n    Those are true facts, and some people do “salami-slice”\\n    their research into as many papers as possible — such papers are\\n    called a “least publishable unit”.  However, doing so leads\\n    to less impact than publishing fewer papers, each one with more\\n    content.  If a paper contains few contributions, it is less likely to\\n    make a big impression, because it is less exciting.  In addition,\\n    readers won\\'t enjoy reading many pages to learn just a few facts.\\n    \\n\\n    Note:  This point refers to taking a single research idea or theme and\\n    splitting it into multiple publications.  When there are multiple\\n    distinct research contributions, it can be appropriate to describe them\\n    in different papers.\\n    \\n\\n\\n    To roll the dice for acceptance on a paper that is better than some\\n    other published papers.\\n\\n    \\n    The reviewing process can be frustrating, because it contains a great\\n    deal of randomness:  the same paper would be rejected by some reviewers\\n    and accepted by others.  However, all great papers are accepted and all\\n    bad papers are rejected.  For mediocre papers, luck plays a role.  Your\\n    goal should not be to write great papers, not mediocre ones.  Find a\\n    way to improve your paper.  Recognize the great value of reviews:  they\\n    provide a valuable perspective on your work and how to improve it, even\\n    if you feel that the reviewer should have done a better job.\\n    \\n\\n\\n    You are tired of the paper and need a break from it.\\n\\n    \\n      If you aren\\'t excited about the paper, it is unlikely that other\\n      people will be.  Furthermore, the period after submitting the paper\\n      is not a time to take a break, but an opportunity to further improve\\n      it.\\n    \\n\\n      After you submit a paper, don\\'t stop working on it!  You can always\\n      improve the research.  For instance, you might expand the experiments,\\n      improve the implementation, or make other changes.  Even if your paper is\\n      accepted, you want the accepted version to be as impressive as possible.\\n      And if the paper is rejected, you need to have a better paper to submit\\n      to the next venue.\\n    \\n\\n\\nResponding to conference reviews\\n\\n(This section is most relevant to fields like computer science where\\nconferences are the premier publication venue.  Responding to journal\\nreviews is different.)\\n\\n\\nMany conferences provide an author response period:  the authors are shown\\nthe reviews and are given limited space (say, 500 words) to respond to the\\nreviews, such as by clarifying misunderstandings or answering questions.\\nThe author response is sometimes called a “rebuttal”, but I\\ndon\\'t like that term because it sets an adversarial tone.\\n\\n\\nYour paper will only be accepted if there is a champion for the paper:\\nsomeone who is excited about it and will try to convince the rest of the\\ncommittee to accept the paper.  Your response needs to give information to\\nyour champion to overcome objections.  If there isn\\'t a champion, then the\\nmain goal of your response is to create that champion.  Your response\\nshould also give information to detractors to soften their opposition.\\n\\n\\nAfter reading the reviews, you may be disappointed or angry.  Take a break\\nto overcome this, so that you can think clearly.\\n\\n\\nFor every point in the reviews, write a brief response.  Do this in\\nemail-response style, to ensure that you did not miss any points.  You will\\nwant to save this for later, so it can be better to do this in the paper\\'s\\nversion control repository, rather than in a WYSIWYG editor such as Google\\nDocs.  (This assumes you have a version control repository for the paper,\\nwhich you should!)  Much of this text won\\'t go in your response, but it is\\nessential for formulating the response.\\n\\n\\nSummarize (in 5 or so bullet points, however many make sense) the key\\nconcerns of the reviewers.  Your review needs to focus on the most\\nimportant and substantive critiques.  The authors of the paper should agree\\non this structure before you start to write the actual response.\\n\\n\\nYour response to each point will be one paragraph in your response.  Start\\nthe paragraph with a brief heading or title about the point.  Do not assume\\nthat the reviewers remember everything that was written by every reviewer,\\nnor that they will re-read their reviews before reading your response.  A\\nlittle context will help them determine what you are talking about and will\\nmake the review stand on its own.  This also lets you frame the issues in\\nyour own words, which may be clearer or address a more relevant point than\\nthe reviews did.\\n\\n\\nOrganize your responses thematically.  Group the paragraphs into sections,\\nand have a small heading/title for each section.  If a given section has\\njust one paragraph, then you can use the paragraph heading as the section\\nheading.  Order the sections from most to least important.\\n\\n\\nThis is better than organizing your response by reviewer, first addressing\\nthe comments of reviewer 1, then reviewer 2, and so forth.  Downsides of\\nby-reviewer organization include:\\n\\n\\nIt can encourage you not to give sufficient context.\\n  \\nIt does not encourage putting related information together nor important\\n   information first.\\n  \\nYou want to encourage all reviewers to read the entire response, rather\\n   than encouraging them to just look at one part.\\n  \\nWhen multiple reviewers raised the same issue, then no matter where you\\n   address it, it\\'s possible for a reviewer to overlook it and think you\\n   failed to address it.\\n  \\nYou don\\'t want to make glaringly obvious which issues in a review you\\n   had to ignore (for reasons of space or other reasons).\\n  \\nYou don\\'t want to make glaringly obvious that you spent much more time\\n   and space on one reviewer than another.\\n  \\n\\n\\nIn general, it\\'s best not to mention reviewer names/numbers in your\\nresponse at all.  Make the response be about the science, not about the\\npeople.\\n\\n\\nIn your responses, admit your errors forthrightly.  Don\\'t ignore or avoid\\nkey issues, especially ones that multiple reviewers brought up.\\n\\n\\nFinally, be civil and thankful the reviewers.  They have spent\\nconsiderable time and energy to give you feedback (even if it doesn\\'t seem\\nto you that they have!), and you should be grateful and courteous in\\nreturn.\\n\\nRejection\\n\\nIf you submit technical papers, you will experience rejection.  In some\\ncases, rejection indicates that you should move on and begin a different\\nline of research.  In most cases, the reviews offer an opportunity to\\nimprove the work, and so you should be very grateful for a rejection!\\nIt is much better for your career if a good paper appears at\\na later date, rather than a poor paper earlier or a sequence of weak\\npapers.\\n\\n\\nEven small flaws or omissions\\nin an otherwise good paper may lead to rejection.  This is particularly at\\nthe elite venues with small acceptance rates, where you should aim your\\nwork.  Referees are generally people of good will, but different referees\\nat a conference may have different standards, so the luck of the draw in\\nreferees is a factor in acceptance.\\n\\n\\nThe wrong lesson to learn from rejection is discouragement or a sense of\\npersonal failure.  Many papers — even papers that later win awards\\n— are rejected at least once.  The feedback you receive, and the\\nopportunity to return to your work, will invariably improve your results.\\n\\n\\nDon\\'t be put off by a negative tone in the reviews.  The referees are\\ntrying to help you, and the bast way to do that is to point out how your\\nwork can be improved.  I often write a much longer review, with more\\nsuggestions for improvement, for papers that I like; if the paper is\\nterrible, I may not be able to make as many concrete suggestions, or my\\nhigh-level comments may make detailed comments moot.\\n\\n\\nIf a reviewer didn\\'t understand something, then the main fault almost\\nalways lies with your writing.  If you blame a lazy or dumb reviewer, you\\nare missing the opportunity to improve.  Reviewers are not perfect, but\\nthey work hard to give you helpful suggestions, so you should give them the\\nbenefit of the doubt.  Remember that just as it is hard to convey technical\\nideas in your paper (and if you are getting a rejection, that is evidence\\nthat you did not succeed!), it is hard to convey them in a review, and the\\nreview is written in a few hours rather than the weeks you spent on the\\npaper (not to mention months or years of understanding the concepts).\\nYou should closely attend to both the explicit comments, and to underlying\\nissues that may have led to those comments — it isn\\'t always easy to\\ncapture every possible comment in a coherent manner.\\nThink about how to improve your research and your writing, even beyond the\\nexplicit suggestions in the review — the prime responsibility for\\nyour research and writing belongs with you.\\n\\nNorman Ramsey\\'s advice\\n\\nNorman Ramsey\\'s nice Teach Technical\\nWriting in Two Hours per Week espouses a similar approach to mine:\\nby focusing on clarity in your writing, you will inevitably gain clarity in\\nyour thinking.\\n\\n\\nDon\\'t bother to read both the student and instructor manuals — the\\nstudent one is a subset of the instructor one.  You can get much of the\\nbenefit from just one part, his excellent “principles and practices\\nof successful writers”:\\n\\n\\nPrinciples\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCorrectness. Write correct English, but know that you have more latitude\\nthan your high-school English teachers may have given you.\\n\\n\\nConsistent names. Refer to each significant character (algorithm, concept,\\nlanguage) using the same word everywhere. Give a significant new character\\na proper name.\\n\\n\\nSingular. To distinguish one-to-one relationships from n-to-m\\nrelationships, refer to each item in the singular, not the plural.\\n\\n\\nSubjects and verbs. Put your important characters in subjects, and join\\neach subject to a verb that expresses a significant action.\\n\\n\\nInformation flow. In each sentence, move your reader from familiar\\ninformation to new information.\\n\\n\\nEmphasis.

of\\nyour career there was another undercover\\ncase all these things are escalating\\nback any second he's going to kill my\\npartner and pull my gun out\\nthat stayed with\\nme congratulations dcio

was\\ninteresting with the understanding that\\nwe're going to talk about the work\\nyou're doing in this season of your life\\nand who you're doing it\\nfor can you tell me exactly why they\\nshould stay and listen to this\\nconversation I think for each person\\nit's different but why should you listen\\nlisten at think cor we're always trying\\nto become something better I wrote my\\nbook becoming bulletproof and I think\\nthe essence of that was I'm trying to\\nbecome more than\\nand how about this the day you think you\\nknow everything is the day you become\\nobsolete I live by that because I am\\nnever at my Peak I am always becoming\\nmore so if you're looking to become more\\nand you don't know what that is\\nexactly then listen all of this\\ninformation we're going to talk about\\ntoday um the techniques the things\\nyou've learned the life lessons the\\nwisdom where is it come\\nfrom what is your if I looked at your CV\\nwhat would I see I probably honestly\\ncame from probably comes from growing up\\nin New York daughter of immigrants I\\nthink that there's one aspect there but\\nI TR think I truly think the majority is\\nwhen I became a New York City police\\nofficer and then I went to the US Secret\\nService and I went in young I was like\\n22 23 and so while everyone's out at\\nthat age partying doing whatever I went\\ninto this this field and I was around a\\nlot a lot of other Elite performers and\\nthinkers and I learned so much training\\nhow humbles you the the job humbles you\\nand then also working in the White House\\nbeing around other top performers top\\nthinkers that really kind of not kind of\\nI mean that really I grew up there I\\ngrew up in the white house I grew up in\\nthe US Secret Service that's how I grew\\nup so I think that those things help\\nshape me and mold me not just training\\nbut also the people I was around I\\nlearned a lot made many mistakes but I\\nhad really good I don't want to say Role\\nModels because I don't like that word I\\ndon't look at anybody and say I want to\\nbe that no I want to be me but I can\\nlook at other people and learn and INSP\\nget inspired from them and see what they\\ndo so I had those examples that guided\\nme so I think that's the majority of\\nwhere that comes from and then the\\npracticing of it flexing that muscle\\nit's like a workout you have to keep\\ndoing that and being honest with\\nyourself you Secret Service nobody wants\\nto hear excuses nobody cares how you\\nfeel I don't mean it in a mean way but\\nthey're like we have a job to do what is\\nthe Secret Service I really want to zoom\\nin on your career experience to\\nunderstand\\num how the wisdom you have was derived\\nfrom different sort of seasons of your\\num experience so a lot of us have heard\\nthis term secret service agent but in\\nbut in reality if I look at the span of\\nyour career what did that\\ninvolve\\nspecifically okay so Secret Service the\\nUnited States Secret Service was\\nactually the uh one of the oldest\\nfederal law enforcement train agencies\\nin the US so they do two things the one\\nthing that they do is they protect the\\npresident everybody sees it right\\neveryone's like oh that's Secret Service\\nthat's all they do\\nNo in fact even that unit of of people\\nthat you see around the president it's\\nvery hard even to get in there you don't\\nyou don't automatically go and even if\\nyou want to go doesn't mean you're going\\nto get it so you do protection president\\nformer presidents vice president first\\nladies even foreign heads of state so\\nwhen the prime minister of the UK comes\\nto the US he gets protection because we\\ndon't want him getting assassinated in\\nthe US so all these foreign heads of\\nstate so you're you're protecting tons\\nof people and it doesn't matter who it\\nis you're the job is I die for you\\nperiod so that's one aspect of it so\\nthere's a very selfless aspect of that\\nwhich goes against all your intuition\\nright because even in law enforcement as\\na cop or police officer they teach you\\nhey if you're getting shot at you make\\nyourself small take cover then engage Us\\nSecret services that all goes out the\\nwindow it's no you're getting shot at\\nyou jump in front and then make yourself\\nbig even bigger to make sure the bullet\\nhits you and not the person behind you\\nso you have to really rewire like\\nsomething that's instinctual that's\\nprotection the other aspect of it is\\ninvestigations they work\\ninvestigations fraud a lot of fraud a\\nlot of complex crimes and today fraud is\\nglobal so you'll be investigating\\nsomebody in Russia I remember there was\\none guy in Russia who's committing fraud\\nhere in the US um he was going into bank\\nbank accounts of these\\nvery wealthy people so the US Secret\\nService and home Homeland and CBP\\nCustoms border patrol everybody got\\ntogether because like we have to get\\nthis guy so they figure out okay he's in\\nRussia so the US goes to Russia says Hey\\nRussia uh can you help us get this guy\\ncan you know can you send him over and\\nso Russia of course is like no we're not\\ngoing to do it to be fair we wouldn't do\\nit for Russia either so it goes both\\nways so then everyone had to get created\\nhow do we get this guy so they're like\\nall right we're going to put a plan\\ntogether to lure him into another\\ncountry a neutral country so this plan\\ngoes into place it's not my case and\\nit's probably Friday night I hear my\\nboss calling from across the way he's\\nlike hey pom purus yes sir he's like\\nwhat are you doing tomorrow I looked at\\nhim I'm like why don't you tell me what\\nI'm doing tomorrow he said can you go to\\nthe Dr Dominican Republic I said sure\\nwhat do you need he's like you need to\\ndo undercover okay what am I doing he's\\nlike we've got this guy in Russia we're\\nluring luring him over from Russia to\\nthe Dr we want to get him and bring him\\nto the US you're going to go with your\\nboyfriend I'm like who's my boyfriend\\nhe's a detective from the L NYPD I think\\nhe was I can't remember what great he\\nwas you're going to be his girlfriend\\nyou're going to give him legitimacy you\\nguys are going to convince this Russian\\nto come to the US I'm like where are we\\ngoing to do this he's like at a resort I\\nsaid Resort I'm like what do I have to\\ndo he's like just make him look legit\\nyou mean hang out by the pool all day\\nand just drink peina coladas he said yes\\nas long as they're virgin I said no\\nproblem MH and so that's what we did we\\nspent I don't know how many days at this\\nResort me and my boyfriend who was like\\n20 years older than me maybe 30 and\\ndinners with the Russian talking to him\\nand what we tried to motivate him by is\\ngreed come to America we'll sneak you in\\nand you'll make a ton of money and\\nbecause we knew what his motivator was\\nmore money so he's thinking about it\\nhe's thinking about it we're having a\\nlittle bit of hard time with them then\\nfinally it's the day before we're\\nsupposed to leave on our private jet\\nwhich is customs border\\nPatrol and I'm talking to my boyfriend's\\ndetective I'm like you think he'll show\\nhe's like I don't know so we're waiting\\nthat morning it's like 5 minutes to 9:\\nwe're about to leave the\\nresort and we're like he's not going to\\nshow 3 minutes before 9: he rolls up\\nhe's like I'm in so we board our plane\\nit's our private jet it's Customs border\\npatrol everyone's undercover we get on\\nthere's like alcohol I don't drink\\nthere's food he gets on the Russian we\\nfly from the Dominican Republic to Miami\\nwe land in Miami do a refuel it's all\\nagents they're watching but they're all\\nyou know reading newspapers everyone's\\nundercover we get back on the jet we fly\\nto New York and then we land in Long\\nIsland in a very in a remote area\\nthere's a limo there our limo my\\nboyfriend's limo with I I don't drink\\nagain I it's like Jack Daniels Jack\\nDaniels Blue Label which is like the\\nfancy I guess a liquor we get in we get\\ninto the limo and then we drive so now\\nwe got them in the US we got them the\\nwas to bring him to Brooklyn to the\\nBrooklyn\\nBridge and the takedown was I take a\\nphoto of my boyfriend and the Russian by\\nthe Brooklyn Bridge wearing their\\nRussian hats cuz he brought Russian hats\\nand that was my clear take us down it's\\nsafe and so I put the photo up the\\nbridges in the back my boyfriend's like\\nwelcome to America we're going to commit\\nall this fraud we're going to steal all\\nthis money the Russians super happy\\nclick everybody comes in we're all in\\ncuffs that's an example of a case if I\\nback up there you said that what he\\nwanted was more money when when you're\\ntrying to understand how to get someone\\nto do what you want to\\ndo what are the sort of core components\\nof that I spoke to um Andrew Bustamante\\nwho's the former CIA agent and he's he\\nsaid he's spent a lot of time undercover\\ndoing very similar work going to foreign\\ncountries getting people to like him to\\ntrust him and then to give him something\\nand one of the things he said to me is\\nyou need to understand their ideology he\\nsays of all the things that make someone\\ndo something is understanding their\\nideology which is kind of what you're\\ndescribing there I think there's\\nideology and the other thing he said\\nthis framework rice reward ideology\\ncoercion and ego and what you described\\nI guess is the reward that that Russian\\nguy wanted when you're thinking about\\nhow to get someone to do what you want\\nwhat's the what's the kind of framework\\nwhere' you where did you default to and\\nI'm and here I'm thinking about business\\nI'm thinking about sales I'm thinking\\nabout all forms of persuasion because\\nthat's essentially what you had to do\\nyou had to get this total stranger\\nsounds like a stranger onto a private J\\nto come with you to America\\nso I'm going to shut up because I need\\nto understand what you want the biggest\\nmistake people make is they talk a\\nlot Steph if I'm doing all the talking\\nand you're doing all the listening right\\nyou're learning everything about me\\nyou're learning about what I care about\\nmy values my belief systems you're\\ngetting a good read on me and I'm\\nlearning nothing about you there's a\\nmyth that people think if I do most of\\nthe talking I have control it's garbage\\nyou have the power because you've got me\\nnow now so what I will tell you is and I\\nknow of Andy what you want to understand\\nis that person's motivational mindset\\nwhat are you motivated by so that is\\nyour value and belief system everybody's\\nmotivated by something different but I\\nhave to hear you and pay attention to\\nyou to understand what that is\\neverybody's purpose is different the\\nexample I gave you with a Russian he's\\nmotivated by money how did you figure\\nthat out was there a certain question or\\nwas it just one his action showed it cuz\\nhe wants money and then in talking to\\nhim he had a I believe he had a wife\\nhome he had a kid home he grew up a\\ncertain way so you just listen here have\\na drink talk to me let me know if you\\ngive people enough space they will\\nreveal themselves to you but we're so\\nbusy talking we're so busy making noise\\nbecause we think everybody needs to hear\\nme I'm identity everybody needs to know\\nme me me me and you know what nobody\\ncares is there something in that as well\\nwhere when you listen to someone they\\nlike you more yeah they like you more\\nbecause everybody loves to talk about\\nthemselves because everybody wants to\\nfeel heard now I'll tell you this though\\nI'm going to push back on the little bit\\nof the like thing because even in\\nbusiness people like I need people to\\nlike me I need people to like me that is\\na Trek for disaster because now you're\\nfocused on not what your goal\\nis but I need to make somebody like me\\nthose are two different animals if my\\ngoal is to do a deal with\\nyou then I'm going to focus on what do I\\nneed to get this deal done if my goal is\\nto get you to like me which is much more\\ncomplex and much more confusing and also\\nit's going to mess me up in trying to\\nfigure that out I say\\nthis don't focus on making people like\\nyou because you can do everything right\\nand people may still just not like you\\ninstead focus on how about I'm going to\\nbe competent in what I do when I say I'm\\ngoing to do something I follow through\\nwhen I say I can do something I actually\\ncan do it when I say I'm going to be\\nthere at 9: I'm there at 8:55 in the US\\nSecret Service we had a saying if you're\\non time you're\\nlate so I show you that I'm competent\\nwhen you see that are you going to like\\nme for that yes you are I'll respect you\\nnow there's warmth warmth is the other\\nelement here warmth is I show you\\nrespect so instead of me trying to get\\nyou to like me how about I just show you\\nrespect what does that look like in\\nreality showing some more respect is\\nthat again the time keeping I'm\\nlistening to you I show up on time I\\nfollow through with what I say I'm going\\nto do I'm also open and approachable I'm\\nalso non-judgmental that's a big thing\\neverybody is kind of like throwing their\\nweight around let me tell you what I\\nthink let me tell you what I think\\nnobody needs to know what you think it\\ndoesn't matter if you're really trying\\nto build a connection with a person then\\nbuild it and let them tell you what they\\nthink because now I see the world\\nthrough your lens not mine I always say\\nwhen especially I do a lot of Keynotes\\nand training for businesses you don't\\nmatter they matter what do they want\\nwhat do they need what's important to\\nthem let them them tell you and then\\nwhen they tell you instead of trying to\\nguess how to enter a conversation\\nbecause you're coming into the blind but\\nwhat do I do I shut up I listen I let\\nyou reveal to me what matters to you\\nwhat your values are and then I come in\\nmore intelligently into the conversation\\nand I speak to you you have to know your\\naudience but you don't know your\\naudience if you're doing all the Talking\\neverybody's motivated by something\\ndifferent if you take my motivational\\nFactor growing up I was never motivated\\nby money my russan was readed that's\\nfair but I wasn't whenever I got a job I\\nnever looked at the pay NYPD I had no\\nidea what my salary was um when I went\\nto the US Secret Service I never once\\nasked them what's the pay because I\\nwasn't motivated by that I was motivated\\nby the mission by the purpose but people\\nwill show you that so the recruiter that\\ntalked to me probably realized this\\nwoman never once asked me what her\\nsalary is going to be she's not\\nmotivated by that those are little\\nthings that people show you\\npeople will show you what they care\\nabout if we just hold back stay silent\\nask good questions and you know what\\nwe're genuinely curious I genuinely want\\nto get to know you I genuinely want to\\nunderstand you I don't genuinely want to\\ntell you all about me that's different\\nand the one factor that's really\\nimportant is not having judgment being\\nnon-judgmental when you show judgment to\\nanother person they're going to filter\\nwhat they say they're going to shut down\\nthey're going to hold back because\\nnobody likes to be judged I would\\ninterview in the polygraph room people\\nwho committed really horrible crimes\\ncrimes against children a lot of people\\nwould say to me how can you sit there\\nand listen to it and not you know tell\\nthem what you thought or not like ream\\nthem out I was like because my goal was\\nto get information see where there other\\nvictims how did they do it I want to\\nknow what they did so that I can make\\nsure that this doesn't happen happen\\nagain and that I do maybe get\\ninformation so I can get a conviction\\nand then I also want to know if there\\nare other victims out there my goal is\\nnot to check somebody and put him in his\\nplace or her and tell them what I think\\nof them those are two different things\\nalso in the room my goal was not to get\\nthem to like me my goal was to get them\\nto feel heard to feel respected for me\\nto be professional and I think we bring\\nthe wrong terms because it's confusing\\nif I want you to like me too think of it\\nthis way then I'm going to think I have\\nto be nice to him I have to be his\\nfriend and when you become you're in\\nbusiness you can be warm but when you\\nstart becoming people's friends that's\\nwhen the lines get blurred and we get\\nconfused in fact there's research done\\nby Susan Fisk and Chris Malone and they\\nsay be warm to people be open and\\napproachable but if you're overly nice\\noverly kind overly polite that's when\\nyou get rolled you want to find that\\nbeautiful balance where I'm a\\nprofessional I'm warm I'm not judgmental\\ncome talk to me tell me but but at the\\nsame time I maintain my authority I\\nmaintain my\\nboundaries what about when someone\\ncompromises your boundaries or\\ndisrespects you how do you react to that\\nbecause I think I have a lot of um\\nleaders around me in my various\\nbusinesses and I see sometimes that some\\nleaders struggle with confrontation they\\nstruggle with you know team member might\\ndisrespect them in some way or might\\ndisre might not deliver work to the\\nright standard and they might struggle\\nwith like pulling that person in knowing\\nhow to do that and how to address that\\nsituation and the avoidance of that\\nconflict obviously just causes a bigger\\nfuture problem because you're setting a\\nnew you're setting a new boundary right\\nyou've let\\nsomeone jeopardize or um cross a line\\nand if you don't I'm assuming that if in\\nthe moment you don't address that\\nthey're going to cross it again in the\\nfuture this is really about like\\nconflict resolution interpersonal\\nconflict resolution and when you've been\\ndisrespected how do you deal with that\\nso the first I'm going to do is I'm\\ngoing to flip it back what have you done\\nto let people think that they can do\\nthat to you that's the first thing I'm\\ngoing to say what standards have you\\ncreated or what things have you set up\\nto let people think I don't have to\\ndeliver on time I can't be disrespectful\\nI can't show up late for work that's the\\nfirst thing I'm going to say so I would\\nha it a guess that I did I in the past\\nset a standard for this right in some\\nway that I showed up in the past that's\\nthe first thing I'm going to do what is\\nthere something I have done to create an\\nenvironment where a person thinks that\\nit is okay to do these things that's f\\nfirst why do you go to I because I'm the\\none who sets the tone for I I I I just\\ninterviewed a chief of station former\\nChief of station John franie he's former\\nCIA and he managed a lot of people and a\\nvery strong a lot of strong\\npersonalities because you got officers\\nand all these different people and he\\nsaid to me you know what I learned he\\nsaid it is easier to be more have\\nboundaries and be a little bit more\\nsturdy and more authoritative in the\\nbeginning and then pull back than to be\\neverybody's friend and then try to put\\nthose boundaries in place the lad\\ndoesn't work he's like you do the first\\nyou let people know what you expect of\\nthem and then you can pull back a little\\nbit but you always have to tow that line\\nso that's what I'm going to say first\\nand he's right what tone have I set in\\nthe environment that I'm working that\\npeople think it's okay to do these\\nthings that's one now let's say\\nsometimes I have an outlier I have a\\nperson who does these things as soon as\\nit happens you have to address\\nit what people do is they don't address\\nthings they let it go it's small and\\nthen it happens again it's small then\\nagain and then we become resentful we\\nbecome pissed why does this person keep\\ndoing it why don't they self-correct\\nagain it goes back to me why haven't I\\naddressed it people are afraid of\\nconflict conflict can be done in a great\\nway you have to think of conflict as\\nthink of it as like I'm competing I'm I\\ncan speak to you not raise my voice not\\nmake it ugly and debate something with\\nyou in the in the the White House next\\nto the Oval Office was the cabinet room\\nthe cabinet room is where the president\\nwould sit with all his heads you know\\nSecretary of Treasury Secretary of\\nHomeland Security and they would discuss\\nand\\ndebate policies laws and they would\\ncompete one person would say I don't\\nlike this idea this is why another\\nperson would say well this idea doesn't\\nwork this is why you have to be\\ncomfortable in doing that most people\\nare not they don't understand that you\\ncan sit somebody down and say Hey you\\nknow this happened can you tell me about\\nthat I had someone who worked for me and\\nshe had made a mistake on something and\\nso it was a pretty big mistake so I I\\ncalled her up and I said hey you know\\nwhat this and this happened you know\\ntalk me through it and I let her explain\\nand you know she said you know I'm sorry\\nthis and that uh there's a reason why\\nbut the one thing I did I said because I\\nwanted to rectify it because I didn't\\nwant it happen again I was like is there\\nanything I can do to help make your job\\nbetter so you can be more successful at\\nwhat you\\ndo because I want to hear is there\\nsomething I'm doing or not doing that's\\nimpacting her decision making or the way\\nshe sees things so it's a twofold but\\nyou also do when it comes to respect and\\nthis is a whole separate thing you\\nbrought up with the respect part just\\nmake sure people are truly disrespecting\\nyou and that's not your ego that feels\\ndisrespected cuz sometimes people can't\\ntake somebody pushing back and if my\\ngoal is to make a great product\\nor business deal or transaction then\\neverything we do should be in\\nfurtherance of\\nthat but what happens is Stephen people\\nare so afraid of hurting other people's\\nfeelings or stepping on other people's\\ntoes nobody says something and that's\\nworse it's sometimes difficult to know\\nthe difference between whether this is a\\nviolation of my boundaries or this is my\\nego because you know I think of much of\\nthe reason why people won't confront\\nsomething in the moment is because they\\nstart double guess whether they're in\\nthe right they're in the wrong this is\\nacceptable this is unacceptable behavior\\nand that kind of mental debate of um is\\nthat actually acceptable that they treat\\nme like this or that they did this or am\\nI just being triggered because you know\\nof some kind of emotional issue that I\\nhave and that kind of conversation often\\nresults in them taking no action which\\nmeans they tolerate that behavior\\nwhether they should or shouldn't and\\nthen it becomes the norm you know it's\\ninteresting so I'm a very um like a I'm\\nquick too to jump and like\\nI don't want to say go into attack mode\\nbut I I have it I'm Greek I group up in\\nNew York and queens it's like it's just\\non so I always have to my immediate\\nresponse is like what internally inside\\nvoice uh I pause and I'm like hang on is\\nthis person telling me something or\\ndoing something that I should\\nhear right maybe they're telling I made\\na mistake and they're trying to help me\\nmake something better or is this person\\ncrossing a boundary that I don't want\\nthem to cross so then I will sit that\\nperson down or have a conversation hey\\ncan you tell me about this what were you\\nthinking when this happened walk me\\nthrough it but I will tell you\\nnon-judgmental right you don't want to\\nshow it it's I call it the poker face\\njust don't show it and let them talk and\\njust see what they're thinking most\\npeople as they're talking to you Stephen\\nthey will on their own realize as they\\ntalk through it what they made wrong\\nwhat they did wrong also you you lead by\\nexamples so sometimes I'll make a\\nmistake I'll miss a deadline with\\nsomeone I work with and I'll say listen\\nI'm sorry I was traveling I own it tell\\nme what I need to do to fix it and what\\nI have found when I do that the people I\\nwork with when they make a mistake and\\nI'm like hey what happened with this you\\nknow what eie I'm sorry I miss the\\ndeadline I own it I'll fix it they\\nreflect back what I show them so I think\\nit also shows in the behavior and and\\nthen there sometimes Stephen some\\nsometimes you'll bring somebody in that\\njust should not be there and then you\\nalso have to make that hard decision\\nbecause that one person it will destroy\\nthe fabric of the group one person can\\ndo that because everybody else around\\nnow watches that interaction and they're\\nthinking well Stephen doesn't care I was\\nlike he's letting this guy do this so I\\ncan do this right it's a I compare it to\\nlike uh when I teach so as I said I'm an\\nagent Professor I teach College I teach\\nundergrad CRI criminal justice first day\\nclass when they come in I tell them no\\ncell phones I was like and the reason I\\nhave you do no cell phones is not\\nbecause I'm I want you to respect me or\\nthis and that I was like I owe ow you an\\neducation I owe you an education I know\\nsome professors don't care but I tell my\\nstudents day one I give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] and\\nbecause I give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] I don't want to\\nsee the phone in the class however I do\\nsomething else it's an influence\\nstrategy I give them autonomy I say\\nhowever you can leave this classroom\\nanytime you want to check Facebook go on\\nInstagram I don't care you have that\\nautonomy but in here I want you to\\nrespect the sanctity of the classroom\\nbecause you deserve education and I owe\\nit to you and I set that standard and\\nside note there's a video clip that I\\nshowed day one and you're actually in it\\nI didn't even know who you were there's\\na clip of you and some others it's a\\nmontage of videos together talking about\\nsocial media and how it impacts you\\nadversely and cell phones and cellone\\naddiction and all that and I actually\\nplay that clip and can I tell you it\\nresonates with everybody and I have no\\nproblems the rest of the semester but I\\nset that tone and I tell them if I see\\nthe phone you're going home no hard\\nfeelings I'm going to pause class and\\nI'm going to send you home and then if\\nsomebody violates it though I do it have\\nyou had to build up\\nyour how would I describe it mental\\nfortitude um ability to be direct to\\nlook someone in the eye to stand up\\nstraight have you had to build that up\\nover time because there'll be a lot of\\npeople who look at you and see strength\\nand they see confidence and they see\\nconviction and they'll Wonder Maybe she\\nwas just born like that or maybe there's\\nsomething she did along the way that\\ngrew that it's a lot of mistakes and a\\nlot of\\ndiscipline and it's\\nalso the people you surround yourself\\nwith will set that example that tone for\\nyou if everybody around me is a mess or\\neverybody around me when there's a\\nstressful situation they fall apart and\\nthey're chaotic I'm going to be that\\neven to this day Stephen I sit and I'm\\nvery aware of who I have conversations\\nwith whose energy I absorb whose\\nproblems I solve I have somebody I care\\nabout very deeply they're in a situation\\nwith someone a relationship with someone\\nwho is volatile chaotic they've come to\\nme so many times I said you need to let\\ngo of this person I will I will they\\ndon't but what happens is they keep\\ncoming to me I'm having this problem and\\nI put them on point I'm like I told you\\nwhat to do now you have to sort that out\\nbecause now what's happening is your\\nstuff is coming into me and I can't have\\nthat cuz I have to keep this steady so\\nsometimes even with pain in my heart\\nI'll have to kind of move that person a\\nlittle bit to the outer part of the\\ncircle does not mean I don't care or\\nlove them but it means your chaos has to\\nstay there because it's going to bleed\\ninto my life you're unsteady I'm\\nunsteady but everybody around me it's\\nlike a I don't want to say it's like a\\ncalculus problem but it's kind of simple\\nmath man look at who's around you you\\nare them they are you and if you don't\\nlike what's going on with you pause and\\nbe like who am I exposed to the most\\nsometimes the people we love they can be\\nvery difficult personalities but even\\nwith them you could say I can manage\\nthis I don't want to cut this person out\\nbut what do I do I just move them to the\\nedge of the circle a little bit more and\\nyou have to make sure your core circle\\nis strong and that's something you have\\nto constantly reassess because sometimes\\nin our lives this person is good here\\nand then maybe 2 3 years later they're\\nnot good anymore but what we're tied to\\nis that person who we knew back then\\nwell they're not the same person now if\\nyou have a [\\xa0__\\xa0] show around\\nyou it's you because you're allowing it\\nto exist so think about quietly how can\\nI create these changes and quietly make\\nthese changes quietly make these\\nboundaries because these are boundaries\\ninternal for you it's interesting I\\nremember watching a video of Steve Jobs\\ntalk about how he built his career and\\nhe said in that video he said I built my\\ncareer by surrounding myself and finding\\nthese truly exceptional people these a\\nplayers and the crazy thing is when you\\nfind these a players they like working\\nwith other a players and it propagates\\nbut the opposite is also true right if\\nwhen you build a circle of drama they'll\\ninvite more drama but if you I look at\\nmy own life and I look at my companies\\nand it's almost this crazy sort of\\nprocess of osmosis when we have chaos\\nand we have inexperience and we have\\ndrama we end up hiring and inviting more\\nof the same whereas when we made\\nthose step steps to bring in experience\\nI'm thinking in my early my early career\\nexperience and maturity and composure\\nand a certain yeah a certain\\npsychological maturity then that's what\\nwe ended up bringing more of more and\\nmore in because like-minded people\\nattract like-minded people and even in\\nthe context of our own lives our Circle\\nwill just you know the fifth person will\\nbecome the sixth person if that makes\\nsense yes it's like they rotate out and\\nit's okay you know what's interesting\\ntoo I'm wondering too because you do\\nthis podcast and you really try to\\nyou're warm you're open you want people\\nto speak to you and I wonder if people\\nthat work with you outside of the\\npodcast or people that work with you in\\nyour business see the Steven on the\\npodcast and they think he's so warm he's\\nso open he's so he's so flexible and\\nthey confuse that Stephen with the Steph\\nwho does business and there can be\\ndifferent versions of You Stephen so you\\ncould think of it and I do this all the\\ntime who I am here doesn't mean I'm the\\nsame person here so when I show up to\\nwork I bring in maybe a little bit more\\nenergy a little bit more directness or\\nwhen i h when I hire people I'll tell\\npeople Hey listen because I want to be\\nefficient at what I do sometimes I'll be\\nvery direct cuz I want to just get there\\ndon't get your feelings hurt if at any\\npoint there's something you're not sure\\nabout please tell me but because I need\\nto get to there I may be just be direct\\nso if you think it's going to be hard\\nfor you I'm not the person I was like\\nbut I will always appreciate you and I'm\\nalways here so I'll sprinkle in every\\nnow and then hey I appreciate you thank\\nyou for this this is great that way in\\nthe so there's my warmth so that in\\nthose months when I'm like hey this\\nemail you guys wrote this is we can't\\nsend this out this needs to be redone\\nand so nobody's hearing like oh I'm\\nstupid she thinks I'm done I did a\\nhorrible job it's like no the email just\\nsucks change it and fix it so we can\\nmove on and do better but think about\\nthe versions you bring in cuz I'll give\\nyou an example who I am in the classroom\\nis different than who I am on the\\npodcast is different who I am when I do\\nthe news there are different versions of\\nme and we have to weigh out those so if\\nyou're going into a business meeting or\\nyou're dealing with people who look to\\nyou as a\\nsupervisor a little bit of a different\\nSteph so they feel it's not what you say\\nto people Stephen it's how they feel\\naround you and if they feel like he's\\nnot taking any of this they're going to\\nknow it it's the essence of who we are\\nit's our ethos is a Greek word your your\\nway of being we show we show people in\\nthe context of whatever environment\\nwe're in the version that we want them\\nto see so that we can get the results\\nthat we want you spent much of your time\\naround great leaders if I think about\\nyou know you were working for about\\nalmost 12 years around people like Bill\\nClinton and Barack Obama and Michelle\\nObama did you learn anything about\\nleadership from those individuals from\\nobserving them and seeing how they\\nconducted themselves and how they\\ncommunicated you know in the UK we see\\nsomeone like Barack Obama is a really\\nincredible leader for many reasons but I\\nthink one of the real standout reasons\\nis his ability to communicate in a\\ncertain way which galvanizes people and\\nwe haven't really seen I mean one could\\nactually argue that Trump has his own\\nmasterful communication skills it's very\\ndifferent but it seems to work you know\\ndid you learn anything from being around\\nthese presidents about leadership and\\ncommunication so you learn you learn\\nsomething from all of them to be\\npresident of the United States whoever\\nyou are I mean that's a feat and of\\nitself so they're all they all have\\nsomething so it's interesting the the\\none thing I learned is\\num resilience you'll be next to the\\npresident and this was every president a\\nforers all of them I stood next to and\\nyou're standing next to them and they're\\nabout to go on stage or in a big meeting\\nor they're talking to someone and you've\\ngot the news on and there's some\\npolitical pundit on the news or channel\\ntalking about how stupid they are he's a\\ndummy he's this he's that just shreding\\nthem and he looks at\\nit yeah gets his stuff together gets his\\nspeech together gets on stage and\\ndelivers when the majority of the public\\nwould sit there oh my God I'm\\ndisrespected I'm this how can they say\\nthat nothing that was amazing to me so\\nnot only did the US Secret Service make\\nme resilient but to see somebody just\\ntake such heat or hear such horrible\\nthings said about them on a consistent\\nbasis on such public platforms and you\\nhave the ability to wake up walk outside\\nthe White House your head up get in your\\nlimo Go on stage go do this press\\nconference and you're like it's just\\ngoing to happen there's no there's no\\nschool for that and so because I was\\naround these these these these\\npersonalities I'm like yeah well if he\\ncan do it I can do it who was the most\\nimpressive I have to tell you they all\\nwere there was no one that wasn't like\\nthey all had their their gift you know\\nand even Trump you brought up Trump\\nbefore I think what people like about\\nhim he's just direct he's very direct\\nand he just lands it he says what he\\nsays and he doesn't care there's a\\nthere's something and I'm Switzerland\\nbecause in the US Secret Service we\\nactually weren't even allowed to talk\\nabout if we voted for someone we were\\nvery\\napolitical um and I've always stayed\\nthat way but from an objective\\nstandpoint people just like the fact\\nthat he just says it and he doesn't\\ncare and sometimes I think people envy\\nthat did you did you see how they made\\ntheir decisions did you ever observe\\nthem making tough decisions yes all the\\ntime you would be behind closed door\\nmeetings you would hear their ability\\ngive me an example of this I'm\\ninterested you know when the stakes are\\nthat high because a lot of us on a\\nday-to-day basis are making fairly\\ninconsequential decisions especially in\\nthe context of running the most powerful\\nnation in the world so I'm interested\\nwhen the stakes are that high when\\nyou've got to get Osama Bin Laden in a\\ncompound in Pakistan or you know there's\\na there's a terrorist attack how these\\nindividuals make decisions they're not\\ndriven by emotion they're very rational\\nbased decisions I weigh the pros I weigh\\nthe cons I look at the facts so you very\\nrarely if ever and I could probably say\\nI've never heard a US president yell\\never I've never heard a US president\\nlose his himself you know when you hear\\nthem debate or talk about things it's a\\ndebate I can look at you you can look at\\nme I be like Stephen I don't think that\\nthis is right and you'd say EV well why\\nisn't this right if we do it this way\\nthis way this way this is going to\\nhappen yeah but Stephen if you do it\\nlike that and what if this happens and\\nthese guys die well I don't see it like\\nthat well Sor I see it this way it's\\nlike we're going to have to figure it\\nout but you're also with people who have\\nthe ability to sit and withstand their\\ntheir feelings are not so fragile their\\nego Not So Soft that you can actually\\nhave this debate and that's important\\nfor you to have in your circle can you\\nhave these debates with people I would\\ncall them competing there's a two great\\nresearchers in the UK Dr Lawrence and\\nEmily Allison and they architect people\\nas animals and one of the things I talk\\nabout is someone who's in control and\\nsetting the agenda is someone who's\\nlying I'm a liying and so sometimes we\\nhave to bring a little bit more line in\\nwith us or somebody who's competing is\\nsomebody who's capable of kind of\\ndebating with you but it doesn't have to\\nbe ugly I don't have to raise my voice\\nor get in your face to break something\\ndown I can sit there and be rational the\\nproblem majority people have is they're\\nso invested and emotional they bring\\ntheir feelings hurt their feelings into\\nit even something you just brought up\\nTrump and you had like a little bit of a\\nlook like Trump because everyone's so\\nemotional when they hear that name pull\\nback and be objective it's like let me\\nlook at this from a factual standpoint\\nI'm going to lay this out I'm going to\\nlay this out I let let let this lay out\\nwhen you can make decisions based on\\nfacts and rationality the go out the\\nwindow you don't want to be an emotional\\ndecision maker it never goes well\\nbecause you're not thinking clearly\\nyou're like just going with the wave and\\nit's those moments when you say\\nsomething you shouldn't say then\\nafterward you regret it why did that\\nperson get me to say that I went in with\\nthis intention I got of got pulled in\\nthis direction this person got me to say\\nthat no it's always on you cuz you're\\nthe governor of you the first time you\\ngot exposed to a president um and you\\nspent time around a a president were\\nthere any things that surprised you any\\nthings that before then you had a sort\\nof Mis sort of ideas of what they were\\nlike and how they behaved that you\\nrealize suddenly were like popular\\nmisconceptions that most people believe\\nabout presidents and so on I don't know\\nif this is a misconception but my first\\ntime they call it standing post um it\\nwas for President George W bush he's in\\noffice I'm standing post for him\\nsomewhere what does that mean oh\\nstanding post is when you're new you\\ndon't get into like the close close\\ncircle of the president it's Evie here's\\nthe door and the president's going to\\nwalk through this door in like eight\\nhours from now we're going to sweep it\\ncheck for bombs and everything and your\\njob is to stand watch the store for\\neight hours nobody comes through right\\nthat's it that's called post standing\\nyou secure the perimeter it's mundane\\nright but you do it it's part of the job\\nespecially when you start so I have my\\none of my first post standing things I'm\\nstanding by the door and the head agent\\nthe senior agent's coming around\\nchecking on us hey you okay you okay you\\nneed anything it's briefing us\\nand then one agent comes and he's like\\nyou're new right I'm like yeah well I'm\\nsort of new I mean I had start under\\nClinton but Bush was my real I don't\\nknow what but my real hardcore\\nassignment and he's like where's your\\nphone I said it's here sir he's like is\\nthat thing off or on silent I said yeah\\nhe's like don't let Bush hear your phone\\ngo off and I'm like what do you mean\\nhe's like if he hears your phone go off\\nyou're going home he's like he doesn't\\nwant to hear phones we want like a\\nrespectable environment a quiet quiet\\nenvironment that thing goes off you're\\ngone he sends people home and I was like\\nwhat why would he get so upset with the\\nphone I didn't quite understand it now I\\nunderstand it because if everybody's\\ndoing this and distracted nobody's Focus\\nthere's things going on it's the energy\\nthe vibration he was trying to be a\\nleader inste boundaries for the\\nenvironment he wanted everybody present\\neverybody's focused nobody's on their\\nphones no\\nshenanigans that really stuck with me\\nand you better make sure I took that\\nthing out put it all the way down I was\\nlike the president of the United States\\nis not sending me home and they're like\\nhe does it so though that's something\\nlike I always remembered and it's it's a\\nboundary and it's just something he\\nimposed throughout the environment I\\nremember thinking wow the president of\\nthe United States actually sits and I\\ndon't want to say controls something so\\nminute but something so\\nsmall can impact or create this ripple\\neffect of the environment that he is\\ntrying to\\ncultivate why did you get that job\\nbecause when I was reading through the\\nnumbers around how many people sort of\\napply to do the initial training and\\nthen how many people ultimately get to\\nbe that that close to these major issues\\nit seems like very few people get there\\ncould you quantify that for me how many\\npeople dropped out during training how\\nmany people passed and how many people\\nhow like rare is it to get to the\\nposition that you got to so they spend\\nlike tens of thousands of dollars maybe\\neven 100 100K by the time you get hired\\non you so to understand how they select\\nyou once you get selected like you've\\ngone through a rigorous process so for\\nexample I started in the NYPD when I\\nwent in it was, 1500 of us and people\\nwould just quit left and right and they\\nwanted you to quit when I went to the US\\nSecret Service Academy at that point it\\nwas like 54 of us but you were hand\\nselected so one you apply and I think\\nthey only take 1% of all applications\\nthat they get which is like it's easier\\nto get into Harvard than and it isn't\\nget into the service so out of all the\\napplications they only they only select\\n1% to even look at then they decide okay\\nI'm going to put this person through the\\nprocess then they make you fill in all\\nthis paperwork Stephen I can't even tell\\nyou the amount of weeks it took me write\\nessays how you're going to handle\\nproblems hey they'll give you problem\\nscenarios uh and they'll say you have\\nthis problem how would you handle this\\nand they'll give be like you've been\\nhere what would you do here and they\\nhave you write out essays and break down\\nwhat you would do then your paperwork so\\nthey take your paperwork they go through\\nall that stuff then they do background\\nchecks on you criminal checks background\\nchecks they talk to all your neighbors\\num when I was in the USC when I was\\napplying I had studied overseas when I\\nwas in college and one of the semesters\\nI did abroad was in Italy they sent an\\nagent to Italy to speak to my college\\nprofessor in Rome to ask him what kind\\nof student I was so they do such an\\ninvasive look into you you do polygraph\\nyou take a written test it's called The\\nTea exam I think they've changed it but\\nit was like in the US it's like they\\ncall it the SATs it was the SATs on\\nsteroids that thing was so hard I\\nthought for sure I failed it I was like\\nthere's no way I passed this thing I\\nsqueak through that and there's all\\nthese things so by the time you get\\noffered they give you it's a conditional\\noffer of employment Evie you've passed\\neverything so we're going to let you try\\nto go to training and then if you pass\\nthat then you go on probation for like I\\nthink it's 3 years and then you're good\\nthen you're truly in but they by the\\ntime you get to this process where\\nyou're actually going to training\\nbecause they've dumped so much money in\\nyou they want you're at that point where\\nyou're typically going to get through it\\nbecause they don't want you to quit\\nbecause they've dropped a lot of money\\non you so at that point they've really\\ninvested in you because they believe\\nthat you can meet the standards and be\\npart of a culture that they want so it\\nit is hard but they do kick people out\\nit happens all the time what is it about\\nyou then if you reflect in hindsight now\\nand go the reason I got through all of\\nthat is because I\\nam I didn't know any\\nbetter I didn't know any better not to\\napply I didn't know any better to know\\nthat it's 98% men I didn't know any\\nbetter to think that I couldn't do it my\\nn my my naiveness as a young woman or\\ngirl that's what help me get through\\nthat job I didn't think about it I was\\nlike why not what were they looking for\\nthey look for a lot of different things\\nI will tell you unequivocally they look\\nfor trustworthiness if you line your\\nstuff and they catch you which later on\\nI became one of their polygraph\\nexaminers and my job became I became the\\nperson to see if you were trustworthy if\\nyou had lied to us I was like the last\\nlayer of Defense um that was a big thing\\nIntegrity is a big thing cuz their\\nmindset was if you can lie about your\\napplication form or something that\\nhappened to you when you're 1920 or\\nsomething dumb you did then you're going\\nto lie to us about anything cuz it's\\nlike if you can't own up to your stuff\\nyou're going to make mistakes here and\\nwe can't trust you so Integrity is a\\nmassive thing the other thing that\\nreally like they call it bqas but better\\nqualified applicants that's what you get\\nwhen they don't want you like hey we\\nhave better qualified applicants that\\ncompetitive\\nwise drugs was a big thing people using\\nlike so drugs played a big role when\\npeople had a lot of usage that would be\\nor when I got on it was like barely\\nnothing um that would be a quick thing\\nto get you disqualified because\\nobviously we work crime criminal cases\\nso if I'm working a counterfeit case\\ncriminal criminals don't really stay in\\none lane they do counterfeit money and\\nthey do drugs and they do other things\\nso they have to know that you can work\\nthese cases and they don't have to worry\\nabout you you said you were working in\\nas an interrogator I read that you\\ntraveled the world for roughly about\\neight years for the Secret Service doing\\num polygraph tests and conducting\\ninterrogations as a polygraph examiner\\nyou're trying to figure out if people\\nare lying you've got a machine in front\\nof you right that's telling you giving\\nyou a bunch of readings and data on\\nwhat's going on physiologically inside\\ntheir body but then also you know in\\ninterrogations but as a polygraph\\nexaminer you you you're looking at them\\nand you must have a bit of a sort of\\nhunch based on like pattern recognition\\nwhen you're looking at their body and\\nhow they're behaving do you think you\\ncan predict or do you think you can now\\ntell if someone's lying to you or if\\nthey're being dishonest it happens a lot\\nwhen you speak to people you can I guess\\nyou can look at it this way you can\\nfigure out who's full of BS and who\\nisn't no one you feel\\nit I think your intuition is a huge\\nthing and we we dismiss it two people\\nshow you you create baselines on people\\nso if I sit and I speak to someone and\\nthe whole time they're speaking like\\nwhen you talk Stephen most of your your\\nhands are usually here you go on the\\niPad you do this that's your Baseline\\nright you do a lock ey contact I've got\\nStephen right now let's say I ask you\\nlater a question and maybe it's a\\nquestion you don't like right I ask you\\nlike tell me about your employees at\\nwork or tell me about the most difficult\\nemployee you had and how did you deal\\nwith it and it's something maybe that\\naffects you you don't want to talk about\\nit you don't want to be honest with me\\nyou might be like ah you know I and you\\nlook down I'm like well you know I'll\\nsee a shift this whole time I'm talking\\nto Stephen he's locked in with me he's\\ngot a certain posture I ask him this\\nquestion he just showed me something\\ndifferent why that's it why and then now\\nI know to be curious that when you're\\ndone asking or answering my question I\\ncome in with good follow-up questions\\nbecause you're showing me something is\\nhappening here what most people don't do\\nStephen is they see something it\\nregisters and they let it go they don't\\nfollow up to with another question and\\nthen another question and then another\\nquestion question you don't want to be\\nnosy but you want to be curious who's\\nthe greatest liar you ever\\nmet can you recall an instance of\\nmeeting someone who was just a really\\ngreat liar I had this one guy he was\\ndoing it wasn't a big scam but he was\\ndoing ATM fraud so you know how you go\\nto the ATMs and you you you go you put\\nin your card you take out money so he\\nwas going on to the ATMs and he would\\nput us on a skimming device this is a\\nvery I don't want but a very primitive\\nway to stealy\\nso he would put on his own skimmer on\\nthe ATM so when you swipe your card\\nyou're swiping it on his skimmer so it\\ncaptures all the info so this guy was\\njust kind of like very lowlevel basic\\ncriminal he's going around to all the\\nATMs in Brooklyn and he's doing this\\nskimming device so on the ATMs they take\\nphotos of you so I've got a photo of\\nthis guy I've got him he's got his hat\\non I think it was like a New York Knicks\\nhat at the time he's got his hat on I've\\ngot his full frontal we found the guy we\\nmatched the prince to the prince on the\\nATM boom I've got my guy got my photo\\nthis easy day I put him in the interview\\nroom I sit him down hey you know I want\\nto talk to you about this first I do\\nlike a a rapport building what's your\\nname where you from talk to me's super\\nnice super nice guy yes ma'am okay ma'am\\nyou know and he was from another country\\nI remember so we're talking he's looking\\nto me yes and he's very very um wants to\\nhelp me yes I want to help you and I'm\\nso you know yes of course like very\\nCooperative overly Cooperative so that's\\nmy red flag I'm this guy's trying too\\nhard and uh sir I want to ask you about\\nthis ATM scam oh no I don't know\\nanything I don't know anything I'm like\\nno how about here and I just start\\nrevealing a couple of things and I've\\ngot my photo in my background I'm like\\nI'm going to bust out this photo this\\nguy's going to be like yep that's me\\nsorry so as I'm doing this I'm hitting a\\nwall no no no I'm sorry Mom I wish I\\ncould help you no no no so I got the\\nphoto of the guy do you know he showed\\nup to my interview wearing the same hat\\nM and I'm thinking I'm locked I'm tight\\npull out the phot phot and I'm like oh\\nyeah then what's this put it down on the\\ntable he looks at\\nit oh yeah that's me it looks like me\\nbut yeah wow I could see no it's not\\nme it was him I got he me nothing\\nnothing he I will never forget him just\\ngreat liar most people waver this and\\nthat not this guy he was locked tight he\\nsuck to that story never gave a\\nconfession thankfully we had enough to\\ncharge him I it was ATM fraud\\nbut not looked at me I'm sorry and you\\nknow one one of the things people would\\ndo doesn't doesn't mean people are\\nalways lying when they do this but one\\nof the things I would see a lot of\\nguilty people do and he did this a lot I\\nswear to God I swear to God God is my\\nwitness God knows that's not me and so\\nwe would call it divine intervention\\nwhenever you'd hear somebody do that you\\nknew it's like okay there's a problem\\nbecause it's kind of like you're saying\\nwhy do you need God to come in to vouch\\nfor you or sometimes we actually have\\npeople come in with Bibles or rosary\\nbeads whenever you saw that in the\\nwaiting room that person coming in I was\\nlike I they'd be like don't even poly\\nthem they did\\nit cuz they're trying so hard to connect\\nto that I'm a religious person I would\\nnever do these things and that those\\nwere little red flags of course I would\\ndo my interview but in my back of my\\nhead I'm like he probably did it what\\nabout other things like um you're very\\ngood at keeping eye contact yes is there\\nsuch a thing as too much eye contact\\nit depends on the person but I think you\\nalso need to be you so I make eye\\ncontact here's the other thing when I\\nmake eye contact with you I show you one\\nI'm confident in myself I also show you\\nI deserve to make eye contact with you\\nthat I am relevant and I don't need to\\nlook away or hide because I deserve to\\nbe here and I deserve to be having a\\nconversation with\\nyou right and that I matter that's one\\nthing and I also convey Authority and\\nconfidence you don't have to say\\nanything to people you show them I look\\nat you I'm comfortable to look at you\\nbut I can also show you warmth right I\\ncan connect with you and engage with you\\nand be present and listen to you the\\nother thing eye contact does it also\\nsends the message to you that you matter\\nto me that I'm here and that I am\\npresent with you and that I listening to\\nyou that I see you and that I want to\\ntry to understand you so eye contact is\\nwonderful because it does two things and\\nmake makes you real feel relevant and it\\nmakes me relevant also that I'm relevant\\nenough to sit here and look at you when\\nI speak and it's another way to convey\\nmy authority without having to tell you\\nhey you know what I'm in charge I don't\\nneed to tell you I show you what about\\num body language you know because I'm\\nthinking about people that I know that\\nare particularly low in self-esteem and\\nthey struggle with eye contact but then\\nalso sometimes they it's it's almost\\nlike they make themselves smaller in\\ntheir in their body language and stuff\\nlike that and I was just thinking\\nlike I I guess what I'm thinking here is\\ncan I trick myself can I trick myself\\nand other people into thinking I'm\\nconfident if I'm not is you know because\\nthere's all this stuff about like the\\nSuperman posture where you can kind of\\nmake yourself bigger and look in\\npeople's eyes but when I reflect on my\\nearly years when I was least confident\\nfor some reason I\\ncouldn't get anyone I was pursuing so I\\nremember there was these five girls that\\nI over the over the course of about\\nsince I was from 14 to I'd say 23 that I\\nwas really into all five of them weren't\\ninterested in me that we would like we'd\\nget a little bit far down the line so\\nthere was like a little bit of sort of\\ninitial um interest but then I would\\nalways lose them and I never knew why I\\nnever knew why but in but then it\\nchanged at about 24 and it doesn't\\ncorrelate to like money or success\\nnecessarily it correlates to my opinion\\nof myself and it was was almost like\\nmagic when I looked back and I thought\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] hell like I got rejected over\\nand over and over again and when I got\\nto the point that I actually believed\\nthat I was good enough even though I\\nread all the books I read up all the\\npickup Artistry books I read the game I\\nread all of these books I had the tips\\ntactics and tricks to fake it but I but\\nit wasn't until I genuinely believed\\nthat I was high value that I had real\\nsuccess with the opposite sex and so it\\nleft me with this feeling that you can\\nread the tips the tricks the eye contact\\nthe body language but maybe none of it\\nworks because there's a thousand other\\nnon-verbal micro Expressions that are\\ncommunicating your low value you don't\\nbelieve in yourself you're not worthy\\nthat overpower that that we can't really\\ncontrol and the reason it changed at 24\\n25 26 27 is because I genuinely felt\\nlike I was good enough for them like so\\nyou know this is why I reflect on this\\nidea of like I know people would click\\npodcasts like this because they want the\\nthe tips the tricks they want to get\\nfrom a to Zed in 3 seconds no they want\\nto get they want to get from low\\nconfident low self-esteem all that to at\\nthe alar with a king and they want to do\\nit they want to know how to do it in the\\nspace of this conversation so that they\\ncan end this conversation and walk down\\nthe aisle tomorrow with their prince\\ncharming that's what people want they\\nwant to solve complex things with short\\nSimple Solutions doesn't exist I know\\nthis book because I know that if I title\\nthis like if you title a podcast sixpack\\nABS in s minutes people are going to but\\nif you titled it six pack abs in three\\nyears of work in diet restriction\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] no one's going to click you know\\nand it's the same thing for for here and\\nlife and I'm often wondering like how\\nhow does someone change the core of\\nthemselves whether it's as a as a leader\\na manager in a relationship that very\\ncore of you because in my life it was\\nactually just this like long grueling\\nprocess of building myself it was at the\\nlike retiring from\\ncaring so much\\nabout actually getting any of these\\npeople and just building up this real\\ninternal Fortress and then everything\\nelse took care the body language the eye\\ncontact the way I walk into a room it\\nall took care of\\nitself and you know but it doesn't sell\\nbooks that like there's no one's going\\nto buy that book you know what though it\\nis all the little things we do that help\\nus get there there's no magic thing\\nthat's why you're like it took me time\\nand what it was is all the little things\\nalong the lines that that that came it's\\nthere's no magic thing people sometimes\\ncome to me and they're like every what's\\nthe secret and I tell them there's no\\nsecret the change that you want in your\\nlife it's all the little things that you\\ndo it's like think of it like compound\\ninterest right I do this and then I add\\nthis layer and then this layer and then\\nthis layer and then this layer it's like\\nthe sheets of paper you put one sheet\\nit's light two sheets are light three\\nsheets but you put a thousand sheets now\\nyou've got weight that's how we are\\nwe're layers and we have to add to to\\nthose layers there's no quick thing you\\nknow when you know you're going to get\\nthere when you're Sovereign when you\\nfeel like I don't need anybody it's\\nwonderful to have human beings around me\\nand I think connection is it's it's it's\\nwonderful but if your goal is I need\\nsomeone to complete me you're done and I\\nthink also it's so wild cuz I'm thinking\\nabout my youth as you're talking about\\nyours when I became\\nSovereign like where I'm like I'm good\\nenough I'm good as I am you become a\\nmagnet I became a magnet people like\\nwell I wanted that I want to be around\\nthat I want to be around her everywhere\\npeople like how do you it's like because\\nI believe in me but it took time to\\nbelieve in me and when you became\\nSovereign yes everyone was just like but\\nhow did your behavior change those micro\\nbehaviors I stopped chasing things and\\nchasing people yeah I stopped looking\\nfor approval I stopped trying to people\\nplease right and I just TR I trusted\\nmyself I also stopped taking inventory\\nfrom everybody asking everybody their\\nopinion and I also though but I also had\\nI dealt with a lot of rejection a lot of\\nlike rejection a lot of people not\\nagreeing with me I gossip growing up\\nthere was a lot I took a lot of heavy\\nhits and those things made me resilient\\nthose things taught me to like not you\\nknow to stay my course like you know and\\nI've shared this before but when I\\nbecame an agent or I put in for NYPD my\\nthe community of friends and people I\\nhad around me thought it was ridiculous\\nthey thought it was silly I remember\\nafter\\nwhen I started dating after I became an\\nagent there was one guy a friend of\\nmine's a good friend of mine's brother\\nshe was trying to hook me up with him\\nthis before my husband my husband knows\\neverything and uh uh so I'm like all\\nright you know he was a nice Greek guy\\nI'm Greek I'm stay I'm keeping it in the\\ncommunity cuz you're supposed to um so\\nI'm talking to him and I'm like yeah and\\nI'm thinking like I went through so much\\nto become a special agent with the US\\nSecret Service and do you know he said\\nto me he's like so uh like when you get\\nmarried are you going to quit that job\\nand you know ditch this I mean like how\\nlong are you going to do this like he\\nspoke about it like it was nothing like\\nit was trivial and I heard that and I\\nwas just like wait what like dude you\\ncouldn't get into the Secret Service if\\nlike like with your like there's no like\\nwith all your might and when he was like\\nsaid that to me and his job he owned the\\ndiner and he owned he owned a diner food\\nhis success was wealth and money and\\nsome cultures including mine and the\\ncommunity I was in they they measured\\nsuccess with money like what I was doing\\nwas not\\nsuccessful but I had the ability to be\\nSovereign enough to like not listen I\\nwas just like no that's not my belief\\nsystem my moral compass and um I stopped\\ncaring then I dated another guy who knew\\nI was in the Secret Service and I really\\nlike this guy it was this Italian kid\\nand I'm thinking he's going to be so\\nproud of me I got in and we went on this\\ndate and he had just broken up with\\nsomeone Stephen like he was so\\nuncomfortable around me why cuz I was an\\nagent they that was like a freak show it\\nwas weird I think today's a little\\ndifferent maybe at that time and do you\\nthink men struggle with strong women I\\nthink certain men do I think I think men\\nwho are not confident in themselves if\\nyou're steady you don't care what\\nsomebody else is you're cheering for\\nthem I ended up dating an agent and\\nmarrying him so because my husband's so\\nsteady and Sovereign in himself I could\\ndo whatever\\nand he'd be like you\\ngo you had your first child at 45 years\\nold I had my daughter at 40 excuse me 46\\nmy daughter's 18 months old your\\ndaughter gets to 18 and she's she's just\\nshe just can't get out of bed she's lazy\\nshe's blaming the world she's saying\\nlisten this is this person's fault and\\nthis person's fault and I you know I\\njust can't be bothered where' you start\\nwell look if I've done a good job and my\\nhusband and I have done a good job and\\nagain it's it's not 100% us we should\\nhave hopefully by that point put in\\ncertain structures in place to prevent\\nthat I'll give you a small example I've\\nnever put an iPhone in front of her I\\nhave no working television in my\\nhouse because I control what she\\nabsorbs not the internet and I'm going\\nto hold on to that as long as possible\\nbecause I've seen with these the cell\\nphones I'm a grown ass adult and I'll\\nlook at stuff and it impacts me and I'm\\nlike I can't look at this or I'll\\nunfollow things or I'll go social I\\ndon't want to see it I cover news I\\ncover crime child I cover really heinous\\nthings and there are times where I do\\nthe news I do the news Stephen I don't\\nwatch it so there are little things that\\nI can do so up until this point 18\\nmonths it's a lot more work for me and\\nmy family there's no social device\\nthere's no cell phone I control that I\\nkind of look at it I want to know what\\nwhat's feeding her mind the way I choose\\nto make her food I choose what goes in\\nthe mind I control it and a lot of\\nparents will come to me and I'll tell\\nthem if you're not comfortable dropping\\nyour kid in the middle of Time Square to\\ntalk to\\nwhoever then you get that thing out of\\ntheir hands because now somebody else is\\nputting ideas in your kid's head I have\\nno control over that zero and that's\\npowerful that's one and especially we\\nsee it affect little girls and again I'm\\na grown woman and social media impacts\\nme and the moment I'm like I put that\\nthing away that's one no TV in my house\\nbecause TV is like when I was a kid you\\nhad cartoons Saturday morning that was\\nit and you had to wait for those\\ncartoons I mean I was like tomorrow\\ncartoons so this instant gratification\\nprocess that kids have that's that\\nthat's why you here like help me get to\\nhear fast she's never going to learn how\\nto work hard she's going to be lazy\\nshe's going to lay in bed she's going to\\nget depressed quicker she's going to\\nhave anxiety so I'm doing everything I\\ncan to impact those things they're\\nlittle seeds it's little things so that\\nby the time she's 18 I hope in my heart\\nI have done my best but I also\\nunderstand I'm 50% she's 50% so as much\\nas I try to help navigate her she's\\ngoing to be her own person and I'm going\\nto have to listen understand what her\\nvalue systems are what she cares about\\nbut her exposure to them is reg I\\nregulate that even the school she's\\ngoing to go to I sit there I'm already\\nthinking about where I'm going to put\\nher to school and I don't I'm like do I\\nwant her in a public school I don't know\\nI don't want her being like mom I want a\\nGucci belt and you know labels and all\\nthis stuff I was like I don't want her\\nto think like that I want her to have a\\ndifferent mindset I'm like so I'm\\ncreating in my head how do I do that\\nanother thing I do super small I take\\nher to gree with me every summer do you\\nknow where we go in Greece in the\\nvillage Village I'm talking like\\nbathroom in the back hardcore like rug\\nin it my parents grew up in villages I\\ngrew up in that I lived in that in the\\nsummer June July August September I was\\nin the village in fact the the bathroom\\nwas connected to the chicken coup Would\\nYou Let Her Fly business class no the\\nonly time I fly business class is when\\nsomebody else is paying why because I'm\\nsaving my\\nmoney because business class is\\nexpensive because I work really hard and\\nI'm okay to sit in the back so business\\nclass there has to be a really good\\nreason why I'm going to dish out that\\nmoney for business class for myself let\\nalone my daughter\\neconomy\\neconomy my poor kid right she to grow up\\nand M like you can keep all your stuff\\nto yourself you um one of the things we\\nwe were chatting about before we started\\nrecording was that your favorite days\\nare when you work out you go to the gym\\nwhy why is that so important to you why\\nis exercise so Central to to everything\\nthat you do in your\\nmind there's I think that there's a\\nschool of like the mind and the body are\\ntwo separate things and a lot of people\\nbe like I'm working on my mind I listen\\nto podcast which is great but then they\\ndon't work out their body and and these\\nthings live together I learned this in\\nthe Secret Service like these things\\nwere they're married so if you're\\ndepressed and you're not getting off the\\nsofa there's a problem your body needs\\nhelp I work with uh I train out with Don\\nsaladino even me with all my experience\\nlike sometimes we need somebody to push\\nus and accountability is a big thing so\\nI always tell people if you're\\nstruggling have somebody be accountable\\nfor you Don who I work with and I train\\nwith he makes me take a photo of every\\nmeal I eat and text it to him he's like\\nI want to see what you're putting in\\nyour mouth and every time I'm about to\\nhave something that I shouldn't I think\\nto myself I got to send this to Don so\\nhe's going to police it so having\\nsomebody help you is also a good thing\\nbut your body is your temple you get one\\nof these we take better care of our cars\\nthan we do this and then we wonder why\\nam I depressed because you have to move\\nthis you have to take care of it\\neverything in the US Secret Service was\\nabout performance this is your your this\\nis your home it houses your mind it\\nhouses your soul and we treat it like\\ngarbage and we give it garbage when I\\nrun and I work out at night all the\\nstress I'm like any other human being I\\naccumulate stress people's anx stuff\\ncoming at me and I need a way to release\\nit so at night I go run and I let it out\\nthere's been times in my life I could\\nthink of two distinct times I remember\\nonce and I don't remember what it was\\nbut I had such a stressful hard day see\\nI went to the track to run I remember it\\nwas freezing it was Winter it was\\nsnowing and I was just like I was just\\nlike on the verge of just like just pure\\nemotion and rage I started\\nrunning I was like talking to myself I\\nwas running I'm balling my eyes are\\nbalding balling I look like a crazy\\nperson to the outside world but I ran it\\nall out and when I was done I was back\\nto me the the the physical element of\\nour body is such an important thing and\\nwe treat treat them as two separate\\nentities and and and they you have to\\ntake care of what houses your soul and\\nyour\\nmind you strike me as someone that\\nis pretty Fearless I I I say pretty\\nbecause we all I think we all have fear\\nin us I think fear is a useful natural\\nemotion but you you're someone that\\nclearly has built up an in uh a more\\nproductive relationship with fear than\\nmost people when you think back of your\\nsort of Secret Service experience was\\nthere a day where you were more scared\\nthan another day IE what was the most\\nscared you were during your time in the\\nSecret Service do you know I had this\\none scenario and I don't think I ever\\ntalked about it I'm in downtown\\nManhattan I'm with my colleague and\\nwe're driving to a Secret Service uh\\nmeeting we were going to go arrest\\nsomebody the next day and we were going\\nto the briefing with this other\\ndepartment we were going to do our our\\npre-arrest briefing about how we're\\ngoing to go in tactically so we're\\ndriving to this meeting and as we're\\ngoing to this meeting we're in downtown\\nManhattan\\nand uh somebody runs out of a it was a\\njewelry store this man runs out of a\\njewelry store and these other people are\\nout there running with him and they're\\nyelling and they see us and I guess they\\nrealize that we were in a police car\\neven though was undercover they just\\nstand out they're like help help get him\\nget him and the way they were acting you\\nthink he would have shot somebody shot\\nsomebody and we can see as you see them\\nscreaming and yelling help help you see\\nthis other person running away so my\\npartner flips on the lights we start\\ndriving and we're chasing this person\\nnow I can't see this person I see their\\nback they have a hoodie on they're\\nrunning from the posture of it of it it\\nlooked like a male and it looked like a\\nguy running so he's running lights on we\\nget on the thing stop running stop\\nrunning he's not listening to anything\\nhe goes he turns the black we're still\\nchasing him then he turns into a a\\nparking garage in New York City there\\nthere's these parking garages and they\\ngo all the way underground so he turns\\nin so we can't go in with the car we're\\ngoing in blind we pull up we get\\nourselves out and as we're going in\\nwe're clearing people out but you could\\nalso see people running out I guess they\\ncould tell something was wrong people\\nare leaving and now we're thinking does\\nthis guy have a gun like what's going on\\ncuz people are responding very\\nagitatedly to the scenario we go in we\\npull everybody out everybody get out get\\nout so we go to the bottom level of the\\nparking garage where we believe he's at\\nlights are it's dark and we go in police\\ncome out police come out he's not\\nlistening we're looking for him\\nunderneath all these cars and then I see\\nhim he's underneath the car and I I go\\nto my partner I sing to my partner cuz\\nhe's like on the other side I'm like hey\\nI'm like he's right down he's right\\nthere now we can't see him my partner's\\nlike I'm going to go around so my\\npartner goes around and he he didn't\\nlisten to me my partner so I blame him a\\nlittle bit he went too prematurely\\nbefore we kind of figured out what what\\nhe goes to go grab him from behind so\\nnow my partner's out in the open this\\nguy's out there I see him I don't know\\nif he has a weapon we have enough to he\\nran from us right so these things are\\nescalating let me see your hands let me\\nsee your hands nothing let me see your\\nhands put your hands out I can see you I\\nsee you under the car let me see your\\nhands cuz now I'm worried he's going to\\nshoot my partner cuz my partner's out in\\nthe open trying to get to him let me see\\nyour hands so then I pull my gun out and\\nI pointed at him let me see your hands\\nlet me see your hands and I'm thinking\\nplease show your hands because now I'm\\nin this cross between if this thises guy\\nhave a gun and if he has a gun any\\nsecond he's going to kill my partner and\\nI had a choice where I was like do I do\\nyou shoot because I think he's gonna\\nshoot my partner because he's not\\nshowing me his hands and he's fidgeting\\ndo I not shoot give him the benefit of\\nthe doubt and then he does shoot my\\npartner and now I'm responsible for the\\ndeath of my partner or if he doesn't\\nhave a gun am I responsible cuz now I\\njust shot him and he didn't have a gun\\nand you're doing this this thing in your\\nhead and there's no way to win and it's\\nhappening in\\nseconds I couldn't see his hands I chose\\nnot to shoot I'm praying\\nthat he doesn't shoot my partner he has\\nno gun he's not showing his hands and\\nthen I'm like I'm going to shoot you\\nplease show your hands show your hands\\nand then my partner goes from behind and\\nthen the guy's like fine fine he's like\\nput your gun away he's screaming he puts\\nhis hands out my partner pulls him up\\nfrom the back and we get him then we\\ncome around I'm pissed I'm so\\npissed we sit him down we cuff him I\\npull his hoodie out 16-year-old\\nkid I searched his pockets you know what\\nhe did he sold one stole one of those\\nbig gold crosses that is all he did cuz\\nI pulled out his ID I checked his ID I\\nwas like do you know I almost shot you\\nfor this do you know we chased you down\\nfor this you almost died for this stupid\\ncross so we call the cops they come that\\nstayed with me because I almost killed\\nan innocent person for what for\\nnothing that was probably very powerful\\nI was afraid I've been scenarios where\\nthe the death was on my receiving in and\\nI was okay with that but I wasn't okay\\nwith this because I thought there was a\\nsplit second where I was deciding do I\\nshoot him because he's not following my\\ninstructions I cannot see his hand my\\npartner's out there he could kill my\\npartner I don't know if he has a gun I\\nhad all these escalating reasons to\\nthink that and I chose not to shoot what\\nis your mental health like generally and\\nthroughout your career because people\\ntalk about mental health they talk about\\nanxiety you know depression low moods\\nand stuff Have you\\never experienced what people describe as\\nmental health\\ndisorders I I don't this is terrible I\\ndon't think so I think I'm trying to\\nthink I mean like any human being I go\\nthrough moments but I don't let myself\\nlive there I guess I always feel like\\nI'm the\\ngovernor I will say this it is okay to\\nbe depressed it is okay to have anxiety\\nit is okay to feel bad I think maybe\\nthat's the issue because we're in a\\nspace where oh you're depressed you\\nthere's something wrong with you you\\nhave anxiety whoa I had anxiety every\\nday when I went to training I always had\\nanxiety when I put my vest on and I was\\nprotecting the present I would carry my\\nMP5 which is like\\nthis a weapon that basically like could\\nit's go into automatic you could cause\\nserious damage like that anxiety I'm\\nlike man is today the day those are okay\\nthings to have so I feel like maybe we\\nshould change the narrative and\\nnormalize feeling bad instead of making\\npeople feel like you're sad take this\\npill you have have anxiety something's\\nwrong with that why is that bad why do I\\nhave to be like every ridiculous\\ncommercial a cuz in the US we we we\\nadvertise prescription medication where\\nI'm smiling all the time and Happy my\\nbarometer for life is not to be happy\\nthe the moments that I've done the most\\namazing things in my life I've not been\\nhappy I've been fulfilled I've been like\\nman I just did that when I woke up when\\nI would wake up at 3:00 a.m. to go to\\nthe White House to stamp post for 10\\nhours outside the Oval Office in the\\nfreezing cold in the winter I wasn't\\nhappy I was freezing I was cold but you\\nknow what I was like man how did I get\\nhere was there ever a day when you\\nthought the president's life was at risk\\nand you were around him was there ever a\\nmoment where you thought you're every\\nday but but was there a particular day\\nwhere you thought no oh we're screwed or\\nthat he was going to be\\nattacked was there ever a moment where\\nyou genuinely thought there was a\\ngenuine threat on his life just\\nwondering yes and no yes in\\nthat like when you would do outdoor\\nevents like certain events where he was\\nvery vulnerable like he's speaking to a\\ncrowd of 10,000\\npeople there's so many things that could\\ngo wrong right so those events like\\nthere was definitely that Threat Level\\nwas heightened um but we had just put to\\nget man the agency was just such a\\ncompetent agency and there were so many\\nlayers of security put in things that\\nyou don't you don't see but it's the\\nsnipers it's the counter assault team\\nit's the air restrictions no planes\\nflying above ground because we put those\\ninto place it's even rad radiation\\ndetection nuclear there's so many things\\nwe do that you the average person has no\\nidea about all the the protocols we put\\nin place so I can't say the president\\nper se because I feel like he got all\\nthe bells and whistles but maybe there\\nwere times where it was hard to protect\\ncertain people and that that's where I\\nfelt it was harder when I protected bar\\nBush Bush's daughter when I had her that\\nwas hard because I did not have the\\nresources that you would have for\\nPresident and she wanted to be a young\\ngirl and go out and date and go to clubs\\nand go to Coachella and do these things\\nI had to take her to Coachella and I'm\\nthinking I got to keep her alive and\\nthis you know it's Coachella and how\\nmany people are coal it's like T\\nthousand hundreds I don't even know at\\nthis point so those scenarios were\\nusually the most uneasy for me because I\\nhad limited resources and it was a very\\ndifferent environment and they want to\\nlive their life is there anything that\\nyou can't talk about because sure if you\\nask me something I can't answer I'll\\ntell you but is I'm I'm interested to\\nknow what you're unable to talk about\\nyou can talk about the cars okay what\\nthe way that the cars work in the\\nsecurity systems yeah the weight\\ntechnical mechanical things with the\\ncars because you have to think of it\\nthis way anything I share here you're\\ngoing to have people that follow you\\nthat listen but you're also going to\\nhave Bad actors who listen to these\\ninterviews to gather information CU they\\nwant to carry out an attack I always\\nthink like that so there are certain\\nthings you can't share I can't share\\ncertain things about Air Force One I\\ncan't share certain things about like\\nhow we positioned ourselves like even\\nthough you'll see agents around the\\npresident there's a schematic that we\\nfollow that the average person won't\\nunderstand how we move our vehicles how\\nthey're positioned and why uh how we how\\nwe would fight an attacker like there's\\nscenarios we play and movements that\\nexist it's like a dance do you have to\\nsign a form when you leave or before you\\nstart to say that I'll never speak about\\ncertain things do you know initially no\\nthere was no such thing cuz there was\\nsuch a level of trust you didn't need it\\nyou didn't need it and then one agent\\nand I love him he came out and he\\nstarted talking about things he\\nshouldn't have talked about um and as\\nsoon as he did that the ndas came which\\nis a little sad because up until that\\npoint it was really just everything we\\ndid was based on the honor\\nSystem did you ever have any form of\\nimposter syndrome you know we talked\\nearlier that when you joined the Secret\\nService there was what 98% men or\\nsomething crazy it was and so as a woman\\nin that environment I know that you\\nunderwent a lot of prejudice a lot of\\ndiscrimination a lot of comments did\\nthat ever leave you feeling like you\\nwere somewhere you weren't supposed to\\nbe or what you know as they describe it\\nas imposter syndrome so I hate that word\\nmhm and I don't live it let it live in\\nmy head and it's like who invented that\\nword I think there's like these two\\nresearches and I want to say I could be\\ncompletely wrong so everybody be kind to\\nme if I'm making a mistake but I had\\nlooked into it and I can't remember and\\nI think it was two researchers who\\ninvented it specifically for\\nwomen so I don't have imposter syndrome\\nI earned to where I got I killed myself\\nto get there so I always felt like oh\\nwow how did I get here but I'm like I\\ngot here so I never let that live in my\\nhead and take up real estate so one is\\nmy NE my naiveness and my ignorance\\nallowed me to get to where I was because\\nI didn't have this narrative I shouldn't\\nbe there by whose\\nstandard that's one the other thing is\\nI'm not going to dismiss and say that I\\ndid not endure difficult things of\\ncourse I did I was a woman yes these\\nthings happened I remember once I was at\\na brief I was a brand new we're at this\\none briefing it's me and all these guys\\nand then um there's a boss giving a\\nbriefing to everybody he locked eye\\ncontact with everybody except me he\\nwouldn't look at me the whole briefing\\nafter every brief and then I ended\\nhaving ended up having it for a boss for\\na lot of things it's like I wasn't there\\nhe looked at everybody else I knew\\nintuitively it's like he feels weird\\nlooking at me cuz I'm a woman like okay\\nI was like I still deserve to be here\\nin those environments if someone's not\\nif you feel like your manager or your\\nyour boss or your or the CEO or even\\nlike a colleague isn't showing you\\nrespect and I I I've read your story so\\nI know that this happened multiple times\\nin your life whether there' be someone\\naround you that wasn't showing you the\\nrespect you deserve um and I have a lot\\nof people that come up to me and they\\nsay I'm struggling because my boss is\\nnot showing me respect or my colleague\\nthis colleague isn't listening to me or\\nall these kinds of things\\nwhere where does your mind default to\\nwhen I say that like where do you go to\\nin your mind what's your like action a\\nso with the last one you just said my my\\ncolleagues don't listen to me I would\\ncome back and I would say give me an\\nexample of where they don't listen to\\nyou right so I would say to you when you\\ndo speak do you look at people when you\\nspeak do you project your voice so it's\\ncalled paralinguistics everyone's so\\nfocused on what they say like reading my\\nnotes or reading my agenda they don't\\nthink about the tone pitch of the voice\\nhow are you deling this are you\\nprojecting your voice do you do you talk\\nlike this when you speak I have a\\nquestion I just want to share\\nsomething people going to like glaze\\nover I have a question or or even just\\nthe tone how you end hi am heavie hi\\nheavie feels different mhm those are\\nsimple things you can do to make sure\\npeople hear you the other thing\\nis I say this a lot when I speak to\\ncompanies cuz communicate is a big thing\\ndon't just talk to talk there's this\\nthing out there and especially with\\nwomen where it's like make sure they\\nhear you make sure your voice is heard\\nat the table I'm fine with that do you\\nhave something beneficial to say or\\nvalue to say because if you don't don't\\nsay anything half the meetings I go to I\\ndon't speak because I maybe I have\\nnothing to say it's so interesting I am\\nfrom being in many boardrooms for many\\nmany years probably 15 years being in\\nmarketing boardrooms not 15 years about\\n10 years is being in marketing\\nboardrooms with CEOs with my team with\\nlots of different people lots of\\ndifferent teams I've had thousands and\\nthousands of meetings I eventually\\nobserve something in myself which is a\\nbit of a Prejudice that I have which is\\nthe minute someone\\nspeaks based on their contribution score\\nwhich is like a credit score based on\\nall of the contributions you made in the\\npast in those first couple of seconds if\\ntheir previous contributions were all\\nvaluable everyone in the room would stop\\nand look and lean in\\nbut if they if they developed a low\\ncontribution score because they'\\ncontinually talked for the sake of\\ntalking i. they just like I'll give you\\nan example um in my New York office back\\nin the day there was this one one guy\\nwho we'd be in a brainstorm trying to\\nsolve a problem and he would start\\nspeaking and you you you'd see by the\\nway he started speaking that had hadn't\\nactually thought through what he was\\ngoing to say and he'd go what about um\\nif we put a I don't know like a popup\\nand uh like maybe we'll do\\nsome Tik toks uh and so honestly what I\\nthen observed from that individual is\\nevery time they open their mouth people\\nwould instantly basically like dismiss\\nthe idea because they had such a low\\ncontribution score and like we all have\\na contribution score you have one I have\\none based on the last 10 years of when\\nwe've opened our mouth how valuable it\\nwas to the people around us like that\\nindividual whenever he spoke EV I would\\nsee the person sat next to him who I\\nwon't name almost like loky roll their\\neyes in the first five seconds and shut\\nit down before he'd even got it out and\\nthen there was this other guy called in\\nmy UK office called Paul never spoke\\nlike never really said anything super\\nmature super experienced guy the minute\\nhe said anything because every time he\\nopened his mouth it was important and\\nvaluable and considered everyone went he\\ncould interrupt anyone the instant\\nsilence everyone stares over at this guy\\nbecause when he contributed we all knew\\nthat he had something valuable to add\\nand I so I would say to my team I said\\nthis to this team that we're here with\\nus in New York like just make sure you\\nproject your contributions goore that I\\nthink that's such a brilliant way to say\\nit yes you're prob yes it's like it's\\nyour score because people keep tabs on\\nyou yeah they know Stephen's going to\\nsay something he doesn't always speak\\nbut if he's going to say something every\\ntime he drops something he drops\\nsomething of value where people think\\nlike I have to talk because everyone\\ntells me I have to talk make my voice\\nheard no shut up and if if you're silent\\nthen you're not of value that's what\\npeople think they think you didn't add\\nanything right well you didn't take\\nanything away either yes I will tell you\\nthis too Stephen when I go to meetings\\nthere sometimes I go to meetings and if\\nI'm the dumbest person in the room I'm\\nthe happiest person MH that's the one\\ntime where I'm happy because I'm\\nthinking wow look at all these smart\\npeople around me and I get to be part of\\nthis I get to listen I love to sit back\\nand listen there's times I just had a\\nmeeting with like my scripted agent\\nSylvie with my manager about some TV\\nproject and I knew enough to know to say\\nI they're like hey eie this and this and\\nI said you know what this is space I\\ndon't know I'm going to follow your lead\\nfill me in I'm taking a seat back you\\nguys do the talking I'm going to let you\\nin on a little secret what is in the\\nDiary of a CEO Cup this cup that sits in\\nfront of me when I interview these\\npeople sometimes for 3 hours and\\nsometimes three people a day and the\\nanswer is this perfect T I invested in\\nthe company on Dragon's Den and since\\nthen they've gone from an idea to the\\nfastest growing energy drink in the UK\\nit is a mature energy drink and it is\\nabsolutely delicious but that's not why\\nI choose to drink it on this podcast the\\nreason I choose to drink it is because\\nit gives me what I call all day energy I\\ndon't get the same crashes that I used\\nto get with other energy drinks if\\nyou're in the middle of a conversation\\nor you're in the middle of a talk on\\nstage or in the boardroom the last thing\\nyou want to do is have a crash you don't\\nwant Jitters and you need focus and that\\nis why they now sponsor this podcast not\\nonly is it delicious but it gives me a\\nsignificant competitive Advantage if you\\nhaven't tried it go down to a Tesco go\\nto a waitrose or go online and use the\\ncode diary 10 at checkout and you'll get\\n10% off and when you do try it let me\\nknow how you get on you're someone who\\nhas a default to taking responsibility\\nyou know like the op the opposite I\\nguess of taking responsibility is\\nbecoming a victim which we talked a\\nlittle bit about before we started\\nrecording but people don't like taking\\nresponsibility it it it almost is like\\nholding a mirror up to yourself it's\\nmuch easier to go through life blaming\\nthe world blaming the government blaming\\ncircumstance luck parents the guy that\\ndid it to me my ex-boyfriend my\\nex-husband it's a much easier way it's a\\nmuch more comfortable way to exist\\nwithin your mind for most for most\\npeople for a lot of people I amum I sat\\nwith a guy called M that many years ago\\nand he the first time he came on my\\npodcast and he told me that when he\\nwrites a book he gets 500 people at\\nrandom members of the public to go into\\na Google doc and kind of read through it\\nand he goes for some reason when people\\ngot to the section about personal\\nresponsibility about 10% of people just\\nclick off\\nbecause they don't want to read that\\nbecause nothing's my fault they don't\\nwant someone to tell them that\\nthey can change their life and I've\\nalways found that really bizarre like\\npeople people don't want to know that\\nthey some people don't want to know that\\nwherever they are now and where they\\nwant to be will largely be based in most\\ncircumstances not all be based on what\\nthey do now and tomorrow and the day\\nafter there's something about\\nvictimhood which both alleviates\\num blame from\\nourselves and makes us\\nfeel justified in our\\nmisery do you know I but some people\\nwant to live there it becomes their\\nidentity so I am\\nthis I am how I am today because of this\\nthing that happened to me a long time\\nago I remember working with this woman\\nthere was a window during covid when\\npeople were writing to me and I was like\\nit's quiet let me do consultations and I\\ndid consultation mentors and I had this\\none woman come to me and I would get\\npeople like what you're talking about\\nevery now and then usually when most\\npeople came to me though they knew what\\nthey were getting but I would have\\npeople come to me that just wanted me to\\nvalidate that somebody else did this to\\nyou or you're okay to feel this way this\\none woman came to me she was a\\ntherapist and she came to me and she\\ntold me about some hardship she had when\\nshe was young I think what what she had\\nwas she grew up with no money was very\\ntraumatic she had to take care of her\\nbrother and she there was a term for it\\nI forgot it was a clinical term and\\nbecause of that trauma today she has all\\nthese issues and so she's like I have a\\nhard time talking front of people I have\\nanxiety and she was telling me this\\nstuff I said why don't we leave what\\nhappen to you here here let's leave it\\nthere I said and let's look at what\\nwe're doing because you're telling me\\neie I want to perform in life but it's\\nlike you've just bought yourself this\\nbrand new Porsche and you're like this\\nthing won't go past 50 or 60 why\\nbecause I'm like cuz you have this big\\nass U-Haul attached to it and it can't\\nso why don't we leave this back there\\nand we'll move forward would you believe\\nStephen she lost her mind she's like how\\ndare you how dare you dismiss what I've\\nbeen through how dare you read the room\\nI will never forget\\nher and the thing was it was so part of\\nwho she was today it was her it defined\\nher so much she didn't want to leave it\\nbehind she just wanted to talk about it\\nmore and so sometimes people why doesn't\\nshe want to leave it behind do you think\\nbecause it's her identity it's who she\\nis it's like people who have been\\nthrough something um an experience I\\nwill give you another example September\\n11th so I was in the World Trade Center\\non September 11th I survived I was\\nalmost killed I lost colleagues and\\nfriends but I was\\nalso around other people who experienced\\nwhat I experienced and\\ndifferent different people behave\\ndifferently and there were some people\\nthat would reach out to me remember this\\none guy he was a medic\\nand he saw what I saw he experienced\\nwhat I experienced and he just couldn't\\nrecover and he would call me up he's\\nlike eie I'm struggling I'm struggling\\nand I tell him I'm like I think his name\\nwas Jerry I'm like Jerry I'm like leave\\nit it's done we're here it's like where\\nwe go and he couldn't and all he did was\\ntalk about it and the other thing he did\\nis he went to therapy a lot of it and I\\nwas like dude I was like I don't think\\nyou should be going therapy about this\\nstop talking about\\nit I was like like you're reliving it\\nevery time like therapy is supposed to\\nlike it's a hypocritic oath Do no harm\\nlike therapy is supposed to help you\\nmove forward but if I was like if I went\\nto therapy every week and I talked about\\n911 I'd be a mess I was like leave it\\nlet it be where it is in the past and\\nlike what do you do with what we\\nexperienced and how do we move forward\\nand how do we help other\\npeople and I like that was a scenario\\nwhere I was like if you keep reliving\\nthis trauma like you become it and it\\nwas him it was him he left being a medic\\nhe Lo his marriage he got a divorce like\\nhis whole life just fell apart but do\\nyou know he wanted to stay there he\\ndidn't want to leave it it was what it\\nwas it defined who he was I met another\\ndude I shouldn't say dude but I met\\nanother man who I knew he was an iron\\nworker nice guy he does a lot of stuff\\naround 9/11 but I remember once I\\ninterviewed him for a news thing he\\ndidn't know anything about me this was\\nstrictly used as a journalist after I\\nleft the Secret Service and it was a 911\\npiece we were doing I didn't say\\nanything cuz of course it's not about me\\nit's about him I remember putting his\\nmics on and doing stuff and getting\\nready to do my video thing with him he\\nhad like 911 tattoos all over his\\narms and like he had a 911 room he's\\nlike let me show you my room and again I\\nsaid nothing I remember thinking I'm\\nlike I like I can't I would never tattoo\\nthe towers on my arms I was like I I\\ncan't I'm like what mental mindset are\\nyou going to be in and he had a room\\nwith all his 911 stuff I was like I\\ndon't I have a Valor W it's not it's\\nunder my bed I my dad had took it he\\nhung it then when he passed away I took\\nit and I put it I put it away again it's\\nunder my bed I think that these things\\nlike there are certain types of people\\nStephen that they want to be tied to\\nthis it's their story and when they meet\\nyou they're going to tell you about it\\noh do you know I would have been through\\nI'm recovering from this I'm surviving\\nfor this you come across those folks\\nbecause that's their identity it's\\nbecome who they are and they don't know\\nhow to let it go and it's okay but\\nthat's for them it's not for me what is\\nthe what is the harm then of not letting\\ngo of our trauma and embodying it and\\nallowing it to become our identity like\\nwhat does it stop us from doing because\\nI'm not a 9911 Survivor I'm\\nheavy that's something I experienced one\\nday in my life and you're going to tell\\nme that one day finds who I am for the\\nrest of my\\nlife [\\xa0__\\xa0] no if it does what's the harm\\nwho's every going to become I'm going to\\nbe I'm going to be a mess I'm going to\\nbe afraid to go in a high-rise building\\nI'm going to be afraid to get onto a\\nplane 3 weeks after 9/11 I got on a\\nplane I was like oh no no no no this is\\nnot kill fear fear while it's still\\nsmall this is not going to become a\\nmonster I got my ass on a\\nplane I was like I I can't na I can't\\ncontrol everything in my life but I can\\nnavigate the out come of my life to some\\ndegree not all I'm not going to be at\\nthe mercy of the\\nworld I I can take ownership to some\\ndegree Stephen but I have to choose to\\nwant it not everybody wants it but it's\\nalso I have to you and I or whoever has\\nto have enough intelligence to see that\\nwhen someone is like that just leave\\nthem they don't want you to fix their\\nproblems they want to be there let them\\nbe there however if it's someone you're\\nlooking to hire or date or hang out with\\nnow you decide is this someone I want to\\nbe around because it is not good for me\\nthose are two different\\nthings I want to come back to this 911\\nthing but I it reminded me of a\\nconversation I had with someone recently\\nwhere they were telling me about all the\\nproblems in their life and problems they\\nwere having with a particular job that\\nthey have and I remember asking them I\\nwas like did you you chose that job\\nright and you can leave and they were so\\noffended by the idea that they had a\\nchoice like and they they eventually\\nthey admitted to me that they could\\nleave and they would be fine because\\nthey have enough money and that they\\ninterviewed for that job and went for it\\nand they also could leave but they they\\nweren't interested in Choice like I\\nremember saying to like I've never this\\nis a good friend of mine I remember\\nsaying to them like why don't you want\\npower in this situation like why don't\\nyou want\\nto be empowered you you're like I could\\nobserve in them that they wanted to be\\ndisempowered they wanted to be powerless\\nthey wanted to be a victim of\\ncircumstance they they didn't want to\\nhave a conversation about choices and\\nthe decisions they could make they were\\nnot interested and I Jesus Christ like\\nwhat a way to live what a way to live to\\nnot want to you know because objectively\\nbad things happen to people you know\\ntraumas they go through things which\\nwere nothing of their doing they weren't\\nto\\nblame but it doesn't mean right that we\\ncan't do something about it there's a\\nvery two different things like but you\\nhave to want it some people don't so I\\nthink what you'll do is you'll be able\\nto people come to you in the say Stephen\\nI need help or this and that but you'll\\nbe able to see who genuinely really\\nwants to move forward who just wants to\\njust tell you about it how do you how\\nwould you be able to identify the\\ndifference so people who are they call\\nit's called being identity and I use\\nthis word before but more in a clinic\\nnot in a clinical but more in the the\\nway that I've learned it through through\\ntraining and my the research I also have\\na masters forensic Masters in forensic\\npsychology when someone is identity um\\nthey use repeated you'll hear them say i\\ni i i a lot you can even see this in an\\nemail um people who identity tend to be\\nhighly depressed have a lot of anxiety\\nthey're very self-focused when they're\\nvery emotional based so you can spot\\nthese individuals now look we all visit\\nidentity land from time to time like I\\nmay go through\\nsomething difficult and have a moment in\\nthis identity space but then I'm like\\nokay I have to recover but some people\\nstay in this space it's like their\\npredominant disposition so repeated use\\nof I this I that I feel I want I went\\nthrough that's one red flag the other\\nthing is they very emotional uh you'll\\nsee they're linked there's links to\\ndepression they're typically depressed\\nbut they stay in the space the other\\nthing is people like this who complain a\\nlot do you know that when you relive a\\ntrauma or you complain or you have drama\\nlike you get those you get those\\ncortisol hits you get also adrenal hit\\nadrenaline hits you you get F3 it's your\\nfight flight freezer response we we Peak\\nand some people get addicted to that\\nPeak I'm addicted to the trauma I'm\\naddicted to feeling that it's like the\\nlast week I was racing a car I was at\\nPorsche and I was racing cars for fun\\nand uh when you're in the car you're in\\nthe present right I'm like sh look\\ntrying not to hit the cones doing\\nwhatever I'm there I'm in the moment but\\nlike my adrenaline's going up I'm\\npeeking I've got my f3s on fire and I'm\\nbut I'm focused it feels I feel\\nalive so for some people when they get\\ninto this state when they relive this\\nstuff and they have these spikes or you\\nsee them very high conflict driven or\\nhigh drama driven they get these spikes\\nand it's when they feel in the moment\\nthey feel alive and that you become\\naddicted to it it also becomes a habit I\\nwas thinking then about the this idea of\\nidentity and what what identity also\\nsometimes seems to give people is it\\ngives them a community and it makes\\ngives them a sense of belonging and it\\ngives them purpose which we're all\\nsearching for like if I'm a insert\\ntrauma then I instantly have a community\\nof people that you know will make me\\nfeel like I belong and then that is\\nsomething I don't want to give up if I\\ngive up my trauma I end up giving up my\\nsense of purpose um my my community who\\nI belong to the way the world\\nunderstands\\nme and uh and that's I guess another\\nreason why it can be so sticky like our\\ntraumas can be so sticky because we we\\nwe build our whole like our social\\ncircle around them we go to events about\\nit we we're in group little social media\\ngroups about it but I think today trauma\\nhas become like a badge of honor now in\\nfact you hear people talking and it's\\nlike a competition about who has more\\ntrauma that's is it not that who has I\\nhave more trauma than you no I've had it\\nharder than you like it's a comp a\\ncompetition of who's had it the hardest\\nand it's it's become like this this\\nthing now to that we put on a\\npedestal I think it's just the new way\\nto draw attention to our eles and to\\nmake ourselves relevant it's like ego\\nand Status it is ego it is status and\\nit's it's interesting the sense of\\nbelonging in group out group that's a\\nwhole other psychological thing if I'm\\nin a group and I feel like it belong\\nsomewhere it's like how G I'm taking it\\nback to Crime gangs or why people join\\nterrorist organizations they join it\\nbecause they want to be part of\\nsomething it's not cuz they're bad\\npeople I want to feel like I'm part of a\\ngroup and so this makes me feel\\nrelevant which is fine but to to agree\\nyou also have to have your\\nyour sovereignty as a person we want to\\nbe part of something cuz we don't want\\nto be out there and alone out there but\\nyou don't have to be alone out there but\\nwe hitch ourselves to these narratives\\nand now my identity is I'm a Survivor of\\nthis I am someone who's experienced this\\nit's like no those are things that\\nhappen to me but they are not who I am\\nI'm an evolving thing I called my book\\nbecoming bulletproof cuz I am always\\nbecoming I'm becoming more I'm evolving\\nwe don't\\nstop I I don't want to stop I'm never\\ngoing to get to a point where I know\\neverything every day I learn something\\nwhat was the most interesting day of\\nyour career when I say interesting the\\nday that you think about and go Jesus\\nthat was like awesome or that was from a\\nmovie so I have I can give you a story\\nwhich I don't think I've shared so a\\nbecause I didn't look like an agent I\\nwould get pulled in for a lot of\\nundercover stuff which I loved it was\\nfun scary but because I never got pegged\\nfor an agent like I always felt super\\nsafe so I did this one thing where it\\nwas another undercover case where they\\ncame to me and we were working with NYPD\\nit wasn't my case but they wanted me\\nthere was this organized crime ring I\\nthink they were\\nAlbanian and they were\\nselling passports original passports and\\nbth certificates to\\nterrorists this is and so they're\\nselling selling it to them to help them\\ncome into the US and to other other\\npeople who are Bad actors so we they the\\nagencies get wind of this they want to\\nget this these these guys this guy\\nspecifically with this organized crime\\nring they're trying to figure out how to\\nget in because they were so good at what\\nthey did like you couldn't get them so\\nthey wanted me to go in undercover and\\npretend to be someone who needed\\npaperwork so they're trying to figure\\nout how do we do it so the the idea we\\ncame up with was I would be someone who\\nhad been sex trafficked from an Eastern\\nblock country cuz I I I can pass for\\nit so um I started talking on the phone\\nI was introduced him through another\\nundercover and talking to him on the\\nphone and I had to develop an Eastern\\nblack accent I need my papers they\\nbrought me here from you know my country\\nuh because when they sex traffic people\\nin the first thing they do when they\\nlure you in is they'll take your\\npaperwork from you and they and you\\ncan't even get a cell phone here in the\\nUS without paperwork so they take your\\nstuff and then they put you either to do\\nsex traffic you know sex work or work in\\nstrip clubs or a both um until you pay\\noff your debt for them bringing to\\nAmerica so I pretended to be one of\\nthose so I you know under that premise I\\nhave no paperwork so I can't get an\\napartment I can't get anything I'm at\\nthe mercy of these traffickers which\\nuntil I pay my my dues which you never\\ndo by the way they keep you locked in\\nand then they make them afraid and they\\ntell them if if you say anything they're\\ngoing to deport you back which actually\\nis not true however so I take on this\\nrole I start talking to this guy I need\\npapers I please they take my papers um H\\nmuch for new papers how did you line\\nthis accent did you just go I studied\\nacting and then plus my parents are\\nimmigrants I grew up in New York and\\nqueens so I just picked them up but I\\npractice it and uh I had to be good\\nbecause if you're not good you get a\\nbullet to the head when you meet this\\nguy so you have to live in reality uh\\nbecause my life is also on the line and\\nso I have these phone calls with him he\\nagrees okay I'll meet with you so my\\nfirst meeting is passport photos I had\\nto go get passport photos I go meet him\\nand I remember when I met him at his I\\nthink he did construction was the\\noutside uh thing he did we meet him I'm\\nme I'm in like dress clothes I'm\\ndressing like very as a very young woman\\nbut I also had to put on sneakers cuz\\nI'm like hey if this guy has to do\\nsomething I need to be able to run so I\\nmeet him I bring my my passport photos I\\ngo to this location that's a front hi\\nI'm here to see I don't remember the\\nguy's name they're like oh no he's not\\nhere you'll have to wait for him so they\\nplay with me for a little while you know\\neveryone's watching me from the outside\\nbut I have no wire on and we debated\\nwhether I should have a wire or not or a\\ngun and I chose to take nothing so I'm\\nI'm I've got nothing with me which makes\\nme more vulnerable but my concern was if\\nthey put me through a metal detector or\\nthey checked me that would be worse cuz\\nnow I'm in their home and like they'll\\njust off me right off the bat so I'm\\nsitting there and I'm waiting he finally\\ncomes then he tries to lure me into his\\ncar and uh I had been briefed whatever\\nyou do you don't get into a car with\\nthis guy uh so I don't get in the car\\nand I'm like no no no no I don't get\\ninto car he's like no we need to talk\\nprivate now I have eyes on me and I want\\nto make sure the agents and everybody\\ncan see me so there's this back and\\nforth where I'm like I please I fre I\\ndon't want to go into the car his has\\npassport phos I give him I think it was\\n5gs I gave him an envelope of 5 grand\\nhere's the five grand he's like okay\\ncome back in like 2 weeks and he's like\\nmaybe you'll get in my car so I come\\nback like 2 weeks later same story I\\nmeet him I get my passports he gave me a\\nPolish passport I won't forget it was a\\na real authentic polish passport and and\\na certificate birth certificate and all\\nthat then I'm like the deal was though I\\nneeded more transactions with this guy\\ncuz the more you get the longer you can\\nput them away but he was so good we\\ncouldn't get anything that we knew he\\nhad done so I'm like hey I have more\\nfriends can I send you more girl girls\\nI'll bring you more girls so oh yeah so\\nthen I start bringing him more girls who\\nare these girls other Undercovers other\\nundercover female agents uh and cops we\\nhad NYPD play and so we go in and we're\\ndoing this buying and selling\\ntransactions transactions till we got\\nenough to get the US attorney to say yes\\nwe got him and then they went in and\\nthey um they took them down that was\\npretty interesting were you scared at\\nany point I was not because I always\\nfelt safe in that nobody Stephen ever\\nthought I was a cop nobody ever thought\\nI was an agent I didn't look like one I\\ndidn't speak like one so I would I felt\\nvery safe on that point because you\\ndon't look like an agent I understand\\nhow that's useful for the for the going\\nunder cover but it it's it's got to lead\\npeople to underestimate you in your\\nprofessional career mhm yes and a lot of\\npeople I've spoken to I was speaking at\\na uh a women's leadership conference\\nabout a week ago in London and lots of\\nthe questions from the audience were\\nabout that subject about being\\nunderestimated and how to deal with that\\nit was a Dei conference so diversity\\nEquity inclusion conference lots of\\npeople that are black lots of people\\nthat are women lots of people that are\\nfrom different sort of minority groups\\nand the com the question came up about\\nlike being underestimated because of\\nyour skin color because of your gender\\nbecause of something else how do you\\ndeal with that\\nand um it's something that I thought a\\nlot about when I started in business at\\n18 years old as a university Dropout I'm\\ngoing into rooms and I'm dealing with\\nmen that are all in suits and they're\\ntriple my age I'm 18 I know they're\\nlooking at me with my Afro my fake tie\\nlike my little cheap tie thinking who\\nthe [\\xa0__\\xa0] is this guy like but have you\\nhave you seen your that underestimation\\nof you as a disadvantage or an\\nadvantage it's how you choose to view it\\nI remember once I was in Africa where\\nwas I batwan\\nwhere I was born you were born in\\nbatswana yeah\\ncabaron yeah I spent a whole month I've\\nbeen to Africa a lot I loved batswana I\\nremember I had to close the windows cuz\\nat the hotel cuz they said the monkeys\\ncome in I was like monkeys I thought it\\nwas cool though I was like no I'll leave\\nthem open they're like no no you don't\\nwant the monkeys coming in your room so\\nI spent a lot of time with batswana and\\nI was there\\nwith um I I did a trip where I went from\\nbatswana to Tanzania and I was with\\nBarbara excuse me Laura Bush the\\ndaughter President Bush's daughter she\\nwas doing some um some work there\\nnonprofit work and when I was her it's\\ncalled an assistant detail leader so I\\nwas kind of like her main person and\\nthen I had a team under me so I have my\\nteam and I'm I'm I'm holding a briefing\\nI'm in charge and we're in the hotel\\nroom we're here there to meet before our\\nour our trip starts so they sent me\\nAgents from different parts of the world\\nthey come in and the first agent that\\nwalked in I was by myself in the room\\nfirst agent walked in he's like hey oh\\nhey hi how are you I'm like oh good how\\nare you he said are you with the staff\\nor you an intern because if the staff's\\noffice is down the hall if you want to\\ngo to the staff's office I'll show you\\nwhere it\\nis you know so I don't I don't show it\\nso I keep my face and I said no I'm\\nactually agent pomus I'm I'm the one\\nwho's holding the briefing hi good to\\nmeet you meaning I'm I'm your supervisor\\nfor this trip and he's like oh okay hi\\nnice to meet you now I could sit there\\nand be pissed about this or I can just\\nleave\\nit sometimes like Stephen like who\\ncares like who cares I can't care so\\nmuch there's some things you need to\\ncare about and some things you don't and\\nas you were talking about you know who\\nwe are when I went to um poly School\\nwhat's poly school I'm sorry polygraph\\nschool it's where I went to the\\nDepartment of Defense to be trained to\\nbe an interrogator it was a really\\nselective School and it was like the\\nwho's who of agencies were there and um\\nwe were all in the classroom and I\\nremember I was walking with a colleague\\nof mine we'll call him k um Kay and I\\nare walking and we're walking back to\\nour hotel it's just he and I and he was\\nquiet I'm like K what's wrong and he's\\nlike he's like you know what he's like I\\ndon't know he's like it's just like the\\ngroup of people and he was an agent he\\nwas a secret service agent I was like\\nhe's like did you notice like did you\\ntake toll of the room I'm like what\\nabout the room he said you know I'm the\\nonly black guy in the room and I was\\njust like huh and I paused and we had\\nbeen there like maybe a couple of weeks\\nalready and I'm like I stopped I said I\\nhad to do the mental like assessment I\\nwas like yeah K you're right you are and\\nhe looked at he's like you're the only\\nfemale agent in the room too and I was\\nlike am I and I\\nstopped and did a mental assessment I\\nwas like yeah you're\\nright and it made me sad in that moment\\ncuz cuz I'm thinking like look what K's\\nthinking about and I hadn't even thought\\nabout it and what what ended up\\nhappening is like I I would invite him\\nout I'm like hey come out we're going\\nwith the guys he's like but they don't\\ninvite me I'm like dude you don't need a\\nspecial invite they don't invite me\\neither we just go and because he built\\nthis narrative in his head cuz he\\nthought he thought cuz he was different\\nor I was different we weren't wanted\\nlike makes you show up different doesn't\\nit you show up different and I and he\\nwas such a great guy such a competent\\nguy and I would and I would actually sit\\nthere I'm like K I'm like nobody's\\nthinking like that and there was a group\\nof guys that were with us that came that\\nwere Secret Service guys and I was like\\nI am telling you these guys are not\\nthinking about you're black I'm a woman\\nlike I don't think they give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] and\\nhe's like I don't know he's like I don't\\nwant to just show up I'm like I do I ask\\nhim every day what are we having for\\ndinner I don't want to eat alone and I\\nwould have to go knock on his door and I\\nremember it came to a point he's like I\\nwant them to invite me and I had to go\\nto the guys I'm like can you guys do me\\nsolid can you invite K cuz he thinks I'm\\ninviting him and I guess it's not enough\\nto have the woman invite you I was like\\ncan you invite him cuz he feels like you\\nguys don't want him and they looked at\\nme like what I was like just go knock on\\nhis door tell him we're having dinner\\ntonight but he had set himself up\\nmentally in such a space and he lived\\nthere and I was like man I can't live\\nhere it's interesting because it begs\\nthe question sometimes what's doing more\\nharm the Discrimination or the belief\\nthat you're being discriminated ated\\nagainst sometimes it's you know I'm\\nblack you're a woman um I I often wanted\\nthis in my early CR you know I had a\\nreally adverse reaction one day when I\\nsaw this grant that they did I was 18 19\\nyears old had no money and I saw that\\nthey were doing this grant for young\\nblack entrepreneurs and there was\\nsomething about it which like just irked\\nme I don't know why I've never really\\nunderstood why but I wanted to be\\nconsidered on my merits not my skin\\ncolor so when I saw that they were\\ngiving out these grants to young black\\nkids you would think I'd go amazing give\\nme the but in my head I was like I hate\\nthat I hate that because it's a reminder\\nthat it's like it's like them thinking\\nand I think this is a super complex\\nthing right for me it was like they\\nthink I'm not good enough so they have\\nto give me a foot up I know it's deeper\\nand it's more systemic but I've always\\ntried to stay away from that especially\\nwhen I learned about labeling Theory\\nwhich you see play out in kids in school\\nwhen they get like an F on an exam the\\nimplicit sort of message to themselves\\nis that like I am an f and when you when\\nyou overlay that with this the thing I\\nwas reading about called stereotype\\nthreat where they like remind a woman\\nbefore a math exam they ask her to put\\nher like gender on the math exam and\\nthen she performs worse or they remind a\\nblack person about their Race by asking\\nthem to tick a box with their race and\\nthen those people perform worse on the\\nexam because we're reminded of our\\nidentity and we all of the identity\\nstuff that you talked about we then\\nperform worse I've always tried to make\\nsure that I don't ever believe that my\\nrace is a is a reason not to show up and\\ngive everything I am in every situation\\nand I I can see how for some people\\nanything that someone might discriminate\\nyou for can also cause harm if you start\\nto believe it you start to embody it you\\nstart to look for it yes and you let it\\nbecome real in your mind this is not to\\nsay that objectively discrimination and\\nPrejudice isn't real I'm I've always\\nbeen well aware that it's real but as\\nyou said earlier I'm also of the mind\\nthat it's not my problem in that moment\\nto try and change someone yes I and I\\nget what you're saying label labeling\\nthe theory we use it in criminal justice\\ntoo when you label somebody a criminal\\nor an offender and you you put that\\nlabel on them they are more likely to\\nreoffend again cuz you're just reminding\\nme that I'm just a bad person so if\\nthat's what I am that's what I'm going\\nto think like and I will tell you every\\ntime somebody asks me like what was it\\nlike being a female special agent I\\nalways get like a teeny tiny Pang and I\\nwant to be like how many how many dudes\\ndo you sit in this chair and ask them I\\nwas it like being in an being an agent\\nwhy do I get that I was an agent I\\nearned it I earned it like everybody I I\\nand I also had to perform like everybody\\nand it's and it yes it implies like and\\nyou hear it sometimes or sometimes like\\nmaybe you'll read like I'll see an\\ninterview of mine and you'll see token\\nhigher female you know how however they\\nword it like oh she you could tell she\\nwas a female higher and you just want to\\nbe like I'm not going to give the finger\\nbecause we're being PG here even though\\nwe've cursed a few times but I just want\\nto flip the bird it's like dude like you\\ndon't know what I went through to be\\nthat don't give me a hand handout I want\\nan opportunity fine but I'm going to own\\nit and even in training they had you\\nknow and I have talked about this before\\nin training like I found out they had\\nmale standards and female standards for\\nperformance oh yeah military too there's\\ndifferent schools on this so I according\\nto this I don't have to run as fast as a\\nguy according to to these standards\\naccording to these standards I don't\\nhave to do as many pull-ups or push-ups\\nI didn't know this when I got hired\\nI find out later because some agent in\\ntraining made sure that I knew hey just\\nso you know uh you got special treatment\\nto get here and I'm thinking what are\\nyou talking about they're like well the\\nstandards that we have to meet and that\\nyou have to meet are not the same\\nclearly I'm not happy about this I find\\nout I get the mail standards and I'm\\nlike I felt horrible I remember when\\nthey told me this I went to my room that\\nnight and I felt horrible about it and\\nI'm\\nthinking there's a part of me that's\\nlike [\\xa0__\\xa0] these guys how dare you talk\\nto me like that I have just as much a\\nright to be here as you and then there's\\nother part of me that's like well\\nthey're right so I was like well I was\\nlike I'm going to have to perform like\\nthey do and so I just started Stephen\\nlike working out like a maniac and I was\\nlike I don't want to hear anything from\\nanybody and I worked out and I worked\\nout and I worked out morning and night\\nso I was like I'm going to be at their\\nlevel I'm going to score what they score\\nbut I will also tell you cuz there were\\na couple of girls in my class like maybe\\nanother one or two I can't\\nremember they didn't care they were fine\\nwith the female\\nstandards so I've seen both I've seen\\nboth I'm not judging them I chose my own\\npath but I've also seen it where I've\\nseen and I can I'm just speaking from\\nthe female standard standard where a\\nwoman was okay who is an agent not being\\nable to do a pull-up and I'm thinking\\nlike that's no good\\neither it's complex isn't it because\\nit's when we have these conversations it\\nalways sounds like we're saying that\\nprejudice and discrimination aren't very\\nreal things but what we're saying is\\nwe're like not going to make them our\\nproblem is not my identity yeah it's\\nyour problem if that's part of you\\nthat's you know and I'm not going to\\ncommit my very limited energy to fixing\\neverybody I meet it's like Jesus Christ\\nI've got enough stuff to be thinking\\nabout then fixing everybody and\\ncorrecting everybody which some people\\nfall into the Trap of that they go\\naround their Liv trying to fix the world\\nand you can't get much done how Tire how\\ntiring is that how exhausting is that\\nand how mentally draining and how even\\njust emotionally like what does that do\\nto your soul that you're trying to fix\\nwho are you fighting I guess that's who\\nwho are you\\nfighting I'm not going to maybe if\\nyou're Sovereign and here and you know\\nyou show I feel like you show people I'm\\nnot I know those things exist I know my\\nparents were immigrants my dad like he\\nwould always pick for Middle Eastern and\\nhe had a even though he was Greek and he\\nhad a really heavy accent I saw how\\npeople treated him even as a man but\\nlike seeing him like Middle Eastern dark\\ntone tone heavy accent like my brother\\nand I we'd go through like security at\\nthe airport he's like we always knew he\\nwas going to get pulled he's like who's\\ngoing you or me and it would hurt my\\nheart to see how he was\\ntreated but you can't sit and fight\\neverybody like I I'm\\nnot the space you take up in the world\\nis just and your time here man it's just\\nso\\nfinite fight who you need to fight if\\nyou have to fight but like you have a\\nchoice and I'm just too busy like you I\\nhave things to do and I can't sit and\\nwaste my time on every buffoon that\\ncomes my way that's sinking and seeing\\nme through a certain Les lens not my\\nproblem sometimes it is my problem and\\nif it's my performance so like with the\\nscenario I gave you before I get that I\\nget what they were saying fair enough\\nI'm not qualifying at the standards you\\nare I'm going to do it but I don't want\\nto hear [\\xa0__\\xa0] from anybody once I do it\\nbut even then Stephen I still heard [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nand that's when know you're the problem\\nI'm not the problem at some point you\\nhave to be able to like write it off\\nit's interesting because the you talked\\nyou did a little gesture then which was\\nkind of it looked like you were making a\\nlittle bubble around yourself and that\\nbubble is in the way that I perceived it\\nwas like I'm going to just protect this\\nspace here because you thinking about\\nthe Border agent that like pulls you\\ninto the back room for four hours which\\nhappens to me quite a lot for a variety\\nof different reasons I was actually an\\narticle about it like a couple of weeks\\ncouple of months back that I'd been\\npulled into this like back room that he\\nthrew airport over and over and over and\\nover again\\nin the moments when I fight that\\nsituation I do so much harm to my own\\nenergy I'm like letting resentment\\nin and it's so tempting because it\\nobjectively probably is Prejudice or\\nsome kind of like Injustice but I have\\nto be conscious as you always talk about\\nlike of that energy exchange it's it's\\nalmost impossible to\\nlike do a one-way transfer of energy\\nit's always like a two-way transfer I\\nthink you can like I feel like it's your\\nmental armor like bubble MH like you can\\nBubble Up yourself you can look at\\nsomebody and be like all right I know\\nwhat I got I don't have time cuz I'm\\nbusy what do you need to ask me are we\\ndone okay because I do agree with you\\nsometimes if you fight it their\\nperception is going to be and I'm\\ntelling you because I'm former law\\nenforcement they're thinking oh why is\\nhe escalating oh why is he this why does\\nhe have a problem but from your\\nstandpoint sure are they picking you for\\na specific reason chances are if it\\nkeeps happening to you over and over\\nagain oh yeah there's something there\\nand there is something Sy there we're\\nnot I'm not dismissing that those things\\ndon't exist but it's also like how much\\nenergy are you going to put in and I\\nguess is the energy you're putting in\\nworth the outcome that's\\nall becoming bulletproof life lessons\\nfrom a secret service agent the quote on\\nthe front from Roger ton at the Daily\\nMail is part Memoir part hugely\\nentertaining self-help manual for these\\ntough times protect yourself read people\\ninfluence situations and live fiercely\\nbecome Bulletproof the paperback edition\\nof this book is now available everywhere\\nand I think uh anybody that's listened\\nto this conversation should have enough\\nevidence as to why they need to read\\nthis book because it's a really really\\naccessible important book that's full of\\nincredible actionable invite advice that\\nwe can translate to the boardroom to our\\nrelationships to our lives more broadly\\nto enable us to become who we want to\\nbecome we have a closing tradition on\\nthis podcast where the last guest leaves\\na question for the next guest not\\nknowing who they're going to be leaving\\nit for and the question that has been\\nleft for you inside the Diary of a CEO\\nis What about your body Health have you\\nstruggled with the most and what did you\\ndo to fix it or improve it after I gave\\nbirth because it was such a my body went\\nthrough so much\\ntrauma I had to leave it alone and let\\nit heal oh you know what else I did when\\nI was pregnant because I worked out my\\nwhole life the entire time I was\\npregnant I didn't work out so I guess\\nlisten to your body\\nand give it what it needs it'll tell\\nyou Evie thank you so much you're a huge\\ninspiration for so many people for so\\nmany reasons that I think i' I'd be here\\nall day if I went through the entire\\nlist you're an inspiration because of\\nyour vulnerability because of the way\\nthat you articulate wisdom in such\\naccessible relatable ways to people and\\nreally you know you said you don't\\nreally like the word but unfortunately\\nyou are a role model to many people for\\nmany many reasons because your life and\\nyour career are evidence to all of us\\nthat we can climb to the top of the\\nmountain regardless of all of the\\nhurdles and obstacles that are in our\\nway and much of that comes down to the\\nway that we perceive those obstacles and\\nhurdles and and also from speaking to I\\nrealize that many of those obstacles and\\nhurdles that are in our way as we\\njourney up that mountain have been\\nplaced there ourselves by ourselves and\\nI think that is an incredibly liberating\\nthing your book is a must read for all\\npeople for both men and women that are\\ntrying to climb their own personal or\\nprofessional mountain and become more as\\nyou said at the start of this\\nconversation so thank you so much for\\nyour wisdom thank you for all the work\\nyou're doing and thank you on behalf of\\nall the people you've helped thank you\\nStephen how many of you started thinking\\nabout your long-term Health when you hit\\n30 for me this was a wakeup moment of me\\nthinking to myself okay I probably need\\nto start paying a little bit more\\nattention now I already felt a change in\\nmyself when I hit 30 with things like my\\nmetabolism my energy levels so this year\\nis no different zoee which is a company\\nI've invested in but also a company
