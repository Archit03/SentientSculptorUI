### Installing Ollama Web UI Only

#### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the latest version of Ollama installed before proceeding with the installation. You can find the latest version of Ollama at [https://ollama.ai/](https://ollama.ai/).

##### Checking Ollama

After installing Ollama, verify that Ollama is running by accessing the following link in your web browser: [http://127.0.0.1:11434/](http://127.0.0.1:11434/). Note that the port number may differ based on your system configuration.

#### Using Docker 🐳

**Important:** When using Docker to install Ollama Web UI, make sure to include the `-v ollama-webui:/app/backend/data` in your Docker command. This step is crucial as it ensures your database is properly mounted and prevents any loss of data.

If Ollama is hosted on your local machine and accessible at [http://127.0.0.1:11434/](http://127.0.0.1:11434/), run the following command:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v ollama-webui:/app/backend/data --name ollama-webui --restart always ghcr.io/ollama-webui/ollama-webui:main
```

Alternatively, if you prefer to build the container yourself, use the following command:

```bash
docker build -t ollama-webui .
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v ollama-webui:/app/backend/data --name ollama-webui --restart always ollama-webui
```

Your Ollama Web UI should now be hosted at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and accessible over LAN (or Network). Enjoy! 😄

#### Accessing External Ollama on a Different Server

Change `OLLAMA_API_BASE_URL` environment variable to match the external Ollama Server url:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -e OLLAMA_API_BASE_URL=https://example.com/api -v ollama-webui:/app/backend/data --name ollama-webui --restart always ghcr.io/ollama-webui/ollama-webui:main
```

Alternatively, if you prefer to build the container yourself, use the following command:

```bash
docker build -t ollama-webui .
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -e OLLAMA_API_BASE_URL=https://example.com/api -v ollama-webui:/app/backend/data --name ollama-webui --restart always ollama-webui
```

### Installing Both Ollama and Ollama Web UI

#### Using Docker Compose

If you don't have Ollama installed yet, you can use the provided Docker Compose file for a hassle-free installation. Simply run the following command:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

This command will install both Ollama and Ollama Web UI on your system.

##### Enable GPU

Use the additional Docker Compose file designed to enable GPU support by running the following command:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.gpu.yaml up -d --build
```

##### Expose Ollama API outside the container stack

Deploy the service with an additional Docker Compose file designed for API exposure:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.api.yaml up -d --build
```

#### Using Provided `run-compose.sh` Script (Linux)

Also available on Windows under any docker-enabled WSL2 linux distro (you have to enable it from Docker Desktop)

Simply run the following command to grant execute permission to script:

```bash
chmod +x run-compose.sh
```

##### For CPU only container

```bash
./run-compose.sh
```

##### Enable GPU

For GPU enabled container (to enable this you must have your gpu driver for docker, it mostly works with nvidia so this is the official install guide: [nvidia-container-toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html))
Warning! A GPU-enabled installation has only been tested using linux and nvidia GPU, full functionalities are not guaranteed under Windows or Macos or using a different GPU

```bash
./run-compose.sh --enable-gpu
```

Note that both the above commands will use the latest production docker image in repository, to be able to build the latest local version you'll need to append the `--build` parameter, for example:

```bash
./run-compose.sh --enable-gpu --build
```

#### Using Alternative Methods (Kustomize or Helm)

See [INSTALLATION.md](/INSTALLATION.md) for information on how to install and/or join our [Ollama Web UI Discord community](https://discord.gg/5rJgQTnV4s).

## How to Install Without Docker

While we strongly recommend using our convenient Docker container installation for optimal support, we understand that some situations may require a non-Docker setup, especially for development purposes. Please note that non-Docker installations are not officially supported, and you might need to troubleshoot on your own.

### Project Components

The Ollama Web UI consists of two primary components: the frontend and the backend (which serves as a reverse proxy, handling static frontend files, and additional features). Both need to be running concurrently for the development environment.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The backend is required for proper functionality

### Requirements 📦

- 🐰 [Bun](https://bun.sh) >= 1.0.21 or 🐢 [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) >= 20.10
- 🐍 [Python](https://python.org) >= 3.11

### Build and Install 🛠️

Run the following commands to install:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ollama-webui/ollama-webui.git
cd ollama-webui/

# Copying required .env file
cp -RPp example.env .env

# Building Frontend Using Node
npm i
npm run build

# or Building Frontend Using Bun
# bun install
# bun run build

# Serving Frontend with the Backend
cd ./backend
pip install -r requirements.txt -U
sh start.sh
```

You should have the Ollama Web UI up and running at http://localhost:8080/. Enjoy! 😄
