## Features ‚≠ê

- üìö **Local RAG Integration**: Dive into the future of chat interactions with the groundbreaking Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) support. This feature seamlessly integrates document interactions into your chat experience. You can load documents directly into the chat or add files to your document library, effortlessly accessing them using `#` command in the prompt. In its alpha phase, occasional issues may arise as we actively refine and enhance this feature to ensure optimal performance and reliability.

- üëçüëé **RLHF Annotation**: Empower your messages by rating them with thumbs up and thumbs down, facilitating the creation of datasets for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Utilize your messages to train or fine-tune models, all while ensuring the confidentiality of locally saved data.

- üè∑Ô∏è **Conversation Tagging**: Effortlessly categorize and locate specific chats for quick reference and streamlined data collection.

- üí¨ **Collaborative Chat**: Harness the collective intelligence of multiple models by seamlessly orchestrating group conversations. Use the `@` command to specify the model, enabling dynamic and diverse dialogues within your chat interface. Immerse yourself in the collective intelligence woven into your chat environment.

- üîÑ **Regeneration History Access**: Easily revisit and explore your entire regeneration history.

- üìú **Chat History**: Effortlessly access and manage your conversation history.

- üì§üì• **Import/Export Chat History**: Seamlessly move your chat data in and out of the platform.

- üó£Ô∏è **Voice Input Support**: Engage with your model through voice interactions; enjoy the convenience of talking to your model directly. Additionally, explore the option for sending voice input automatically after 3 seconds of silence for a streamlined experience.

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Fine-Tuned Control with Advanced Parameters**: Gain a deeper level of control by adjusting parameters such as temperature and defining your system prompts to tailor the conversation to your specific preferences and needs.

- üé®ü§ñ **Image Generation Integration**: Seamlessly incorporate image generation capabilities using AUTOMATIC1111 API (local) and DALL-E, enriching your chat experience with dynamic visual content.

- ü§ù **OpenAI API Integration**: Effortlessly integrate OpenAI-compatible API for versatile conversations alongside Ollama models. Customize the API Base URL to link with **LMStudio, Mistral, OpenRouter, and more**.

- ‚ú® **Multiple OpenAI-Compatible API Support**: Seamlessly integrate and customize various OpenAI-compatible APIs, enhancing the versatility of your chat interactions.

- üîó **External Ollama Server Connection**: Seamlessly link to an external Ollama server hosted on a different address by configuring the environment variable.

- üë• **Multi-User Management**: Easily oversee and administer users via our intuitive admin panel, streamlining user management processes.

- üîê **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Ensure secure access with restricted permissions; only authorized individuals can access your Ollama, and exclusive model creation/pulling rights are reserved for administrators.


- üåêüåç **Multilingual Support**: Experience Open WebUI in your preferred language with our internationalization (i18n) support. Join us in expanding our supported languages! We're actively seeking contributors!

## How to Install üöÄ

> [!NOTE]  
> Please note that for certain Docker environments, additional configurations might be needed. If you encounter any connection issues, our detailed guide on [Open WebUI Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/) is ready to assist you.

### Quick Start with Docker üê≥

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When using Docker to install Open WebUI, make sure to include the `-v open-webui:/app/backend/data` in your Docker command. This step is crucial as it ensures your database is properly mounted and prevents any loss of data.

- **If Ollama is on your computer**, use this command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
  ```

- **If Ollama is on a Different Server**, use this command:

- To connect to Ollama on another server, change the `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` to the server's URL:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -e OLLAMA_BASE_URL=https://example.com -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
  ```

- After installation, you can access Open WebUI at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Enjoy! üòÑ

#### Open WebUI: Server Connection Error

If you're experiencing connection issues, it‚Äôs often due to the WebUI docker container not being able to reach the Ollama server at 127.0.0.1:11434 (host.docker.internal:11434) inside the container . Use the `--network=host` flag in your docker command to resolve this. Note that the port changes from 3000 to 8080, resulting in the link: `http://localhost:8080`.

**Example Docker Command**:

```bash
docker run -d --network=host -v open-webui:/app/backend/data -e OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11434 --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
```
git clone https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui.git
cd open-webui/

# Copying required .env file
