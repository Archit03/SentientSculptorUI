## How to Install üöÄ

### Installing Both Ollama and Ollama Web UI Using Docker Compose

If you don't have Ollama installed yet, you can use the provided Docker Compose file for a hassle-free installation. Simply run the following command:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

This command will install both Ollama and Ollama Web UI on your system. Ensure to modify the `compose.yaml` file for GPU support and Exposing Ollama API outside the container stack if needed.

### Installing Ollama Web UI Only

#### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the latest version of Ollama installed before proceeding with the installation. You can find the latest version of Ollama at [https://ollama.ai/](https://ollama.ai/).

##### Checking Ollama

After installing Ollama, verify that Ollama is running by accessing the following link in your web browser: [http://127.0.0.1:11434/](http://127.0.0.1:11434/). Note that the port number may differ based on your system configuration.

#### Using Docker üê≥

If Ollama is hosted on your local machine and accessible at [http://127.0.0.1:11434/](http://127.0.0.1:11434/), run the following command:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway --name ollama-webui --restart always ghcr.io/ollama-webui/ollama-webui:main
```

Alternatively, if you prefer to build the container yourself, use the following command:

```bash
docker build -t ollama-webui .
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway --name ollama-webui --restart always ollama-webui
```

Your Ollama Web UI should now be hosted at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and accessible over LAN (or Network). Enjoy! üòÑ

#### Accessing External Ollama on a Different Server

Change `OLLAMA_API_BASE_URL` environment variable to match the external Ollama Server url:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -e OLLAMA_API_BASE_URL=https://example.com/api --name ollama-webui --restart always ghcr.io/ollama-webui/ollama-webui:main
```

Alternatively, if you prefer to build the container yourself, use the following command:

```bash
docker build -t ollama-webui .
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -e OLLAMA_API_BASE_URL=https://example.com/api --name ollama-webui --restart always ollama-webui
```

## How to Install Without Docker

While we strongly recommend using our convenient Docker container installation for optimal support, we understand that some situations may require a non-Docker setup, especially for development purposes. Please note that non-Docker installations are not officially supported, and you might need to troubleshoot on your own.

### TL;DR üöÄ

Run the following commands to install:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ollama-webui/ollama-webui.git
cd ollama-webui/

# Copying required .env file
cp -RPp example.env .env

# Building Frontend
npm i
npm run build

# Serving Frontend with the Backend
cd ./backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
sh start.sh
```

You should have the Ollama Web UI up and running at http://localhost:8080/. Enjoy! üòÑ

### Project Components

The Ollama Web UI consists of two primary components: the frontend and the backend (which serves as a reverse proxy, handling static frontend files, and additional features). Both need to be running concurrently for the development environment using `npm run dev`. Alternatively, you can set the `PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` during the build process to have the frontend connect directly to your Ollama instance or build the frontend as static files and serve them with the backend.

### Prerequisites

1. **Clone and Enter the Project:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ollama-webui/ollama-webui.git
   cd ollama-webui/
   ```

2. **Create and Edit `.env`:**

   ```sh
   cp -RPp example.env .env
   ```

### Building Ollama Web UI Frontend

1. **Install Node Dependencies:**

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run in Dev Mode or Build for Deployment:**

   - Dev Mode (requires the backend to be running simultaneously):

     ```sh
     npm run dev
     ```

   - Build for Deployment:

     ```sh
     # `PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` overwrites the value in `.env`
     PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL='https://example.com/api' npm run build
     ```

3. **Test the Build with `Caddy` (or your preferred server):**

   ```sh
   curl https://webi.sh/caddy | sh

   PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL='https://localhost/api' npm run build
   caddy run --envfile .env --config ./Caddyfile.localhost
   ```

### Running Ollama Web UI Backend

If you wish to run the backend for deployment, ensure that the frontend is built so that the backend can serve the frontend files along with the API route.

#### Setup Instructions

1. **Install Python Requirements:**

   ```sh
   cd ./backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run Python Backend:**

   - Dev Mode with Hot Reloading:

     ```sh
     sh dev.sh
     ```

   - Deployment:

     ```sh
     sh start.sh
     ```

Now, you should have the Ollama Web UI up and running at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/). Feel free to explore the features and functionalities of Ollama! If you encounter any issues, please refer to the instructions above or reach out to the community for assistance.
